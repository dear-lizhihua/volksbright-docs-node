Node.js has a concept of a “Node.js instance”, that is commonly being referred
to as `node::Environment`. Each `node::Environment` is associated with:

* Exactly one `v8::Isolate`, i.e. one JS Engine instance,
* Exactly one `uv_loop_t`, i.e. one event loop, and
* A number of `v8::Context`s, but exactly one main `v8::Context`.
* One `node::IsolateData` instance that contains information that could be
  shared by multiple `node::Environment`s that use the same `v8::Isolate`.
  Currently, no testing if performed for this scenario.

In order to set up a `v8::Isolate`, an `v8::ArrayBuffer::Allocator` needs
to be provided. One possible choice is the default Node.js allocator, which
can be created through `node::ArrayBufferAllocator::Create()`. Using the Node.js
allocator allows minor performance optimizations when addons use the Node.js
C++ `Buffer` API, and is required in order to track `ArrayBuffer` memory in
[`process.memoryUsage()`][].

Additionally, each `v8::Isolate` that is used for a Node.js instance needs to
be registered and unregistered with the `MultiIsolatePlatform` instance, if one
is being used, in order for the platform to know which event loop to use
for tasks scheduled by the `v8::Isolate`.

The `node::NewIsolate()` helper function creates a `v8::Isolate`,
sets it up with some Node.js-specific hooks (e.g. the Node.js error handler),
and registers it with the platform automatically.

```cpp
int RunNodeInstance(MultiIsolatePlatform* platform,
                    const std::vector<std::string>& args,
                    const std::vector<std::string>& exec_args) {
  int exit_code = 0;

  // Setup up a libuv event loop, v8::Isolate, and Node.js Environment.
  std::vector<std::string> errors;
  std::unique_ptr<CommonEnvironmentSetup> setup =
      CommonEnvironmentSetup::Create(platform, &errors, args, exec_args);
  if (!setup) {
    for (const std::string& err : errors)
      fprintf(stderr, "%s: %s\n", args[0].c_str(), err.c_str());
    return 1;
  }

  Isolate* isolate = setup->isolate();
  Environment* env = setup->env();

  {
    Locker locker(isolate);
    Isolate::Scope isolate_scope(isolate);
    HandleScope handle_scope(isolate);
    // The v8::Context needs to be entered when node::CreateEnvironment() and
    // node::LoadEnvironment() are being called.
    Context::Scope context_scope(setup->context());

    // Set up the Node.js instance for execution, and run code inside of it.
    // There is also a variant that takes a callback and provides it with
    // the `require` and `process` objects, so that it can manually compile
    // and run scripts as needed.
    // The `require` function inside this script does *not* access the file
    // system, and can only load built-in Node.js modules.
    // `module.createRequire()` is being used to create one that is able to
    // load files from the disk, and uses the standard CommonJS file loader
    // instead of the internal-only `require` function.
    MaybeLocal<Value> loadenv_ret = node::LoadEnvironment(
        env,
        "const publicRequire ="
        "  require('node:module').createRequire(process.cwd() + '/');"
        "globalThis.require = publicRequire;"
        "require('node:vm').runInThisContext(process.argv[1]);");

    if (loadenv_ret.IsEmpty())  // There has been a JS exception.
      return 1;

    exit_code = node::SpinEventLoop(env).FromMaybe(1);

    // node::Stop() can be used to explicitly stop the event loop and keep
    // further JavaScript from running. It can be called from any thread,
    // and will act like worker.terminate() if called from another thread.
    node::Stop(env);
  }

  return exit_code;
}
