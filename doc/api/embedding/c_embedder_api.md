# C++ embedder API

<!--introduced_in=v12.19.0-->

Node.js provides a number of C++ APIs that can be used to execute JavaScript
in a Node.js environment from other C++ software.

The documentation for these APIs can be found in [src/node.h][] in the Node.js
source tree. In addition to the APIs exposed by Node.js, some required concepts
are provided by the V8 embedder API.

Because using Node.js as an embedded library is different from writing code
that is executed by Node.js, breaking changes do not follow typical Node.js
[deprecation policy][] and may occur on each semver-major release without prior
warning.
