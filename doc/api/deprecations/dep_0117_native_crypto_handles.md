Type: End-of-Life

Previous versions of Node.js exposed handles to internal native objects through
the `_handle` property of the `Cipher`, `Decipher`, `DiffieHellman`,
`DiffieHellmanGroup`, `ECDH`, `Hash`, `Hmac`, `Sign`, and `Verify` classes.
The `_handle` property has been removed because improper use of the native
object can lead to crashing the application.
