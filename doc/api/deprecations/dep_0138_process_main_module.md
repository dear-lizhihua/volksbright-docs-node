Type: Documentation-only

[`process.mainModule`][] is a CommonJS-only feature while `process` global
object is shared with non-CommonJS environment. Its use within ECMAScript
modules is unsupported.

It is deprecated in favor of [`require.main`][], because it serves the same
purpose and is only available on CommonJS environment.
