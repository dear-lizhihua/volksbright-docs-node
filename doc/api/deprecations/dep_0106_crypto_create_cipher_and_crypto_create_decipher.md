Type: Runtime

Using [`crypto.createCipher()`][] and [`crypto.createDecipher()`][] must be
avoided as they use a weak key derivation function (MD5 with no salt) and static
initialization vectors. It is recommended to derive a key using
[`crypto.pbkdf2()`][] or [`crypto.scrypt()`][] with random salts and to use
[`crypto.createCipheriv()`][] and [`crypto.createDecipheriv()`][] to obtain the
[`Cipher`][] and [`Decipher`][] objects respectively.
