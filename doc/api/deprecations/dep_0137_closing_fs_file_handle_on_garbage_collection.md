Type: Runtime

Allowing a [`fs.FileHandle`][] object to be closed on garbage collection is
deprecated. In the future, doing so might result in a thrown error that will
terminate the process.

Please ensure that all `fs.FileHandle` objects are explicitly closed using
`FileHandle.prototype.close()` when the `fs.FileHandle` is no longer needed:

```js
const fsPromises = require('node:fs').promises;
async function openAndClose() {
  let filehandle;
  try {
    filehandle = await fsPromises.open('thefile.txt', 'r');
  } finally {
    if (filehandle !== undefined)
      await filehandle.close();
  }
}
```
