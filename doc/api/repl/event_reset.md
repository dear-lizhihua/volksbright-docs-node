### Event: `'reset'`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.11.0
-->

The `'reset'` event is emitted when the REPL's context is reset. This occurs
whenever the `.clear` command is received as input _unless_ the REPL is using
the default evaluator and the `repl.REPLServer` instance was created with the
`useGlobal` option set to `true`. The listener callback will be called with a
reference to the `context` object as the only argument.

This can be used primarily to re-initialize REPL context to some pre-defined
state:

```js
const repl = require('node:repl');

function initializeContext(context) {
  context.m = 'test';
}

const r = repl.start({ prompt: '> ' });
initializeContext(r.context);

r.on('reset', initializeContext);
```

When this code is executed, the global `'m'` variable can be modified but then
reset to its initial value using the `.clear` command:

```console
$ ./node example.js
> m
'test'
> m = 1
1
> m
1
> .clear
Clearing context...
> m
'test'
>
```
