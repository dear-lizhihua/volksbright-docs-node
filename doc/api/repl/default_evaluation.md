### Default evaluation

By default, all instances of [`repl.REPLServer`][] use an evaluation function
that evaluates JavaScript expressions and provides access to Node.js built-in
modules. This default behavior can be overridden by passing in an alternative
evaluation function when the [`repl.REPLServer`][] instance is created.
