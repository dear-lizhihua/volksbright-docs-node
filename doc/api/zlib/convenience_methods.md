## Convenience methods

<!--type=misc-->

All of these take a [`Buffer`][], [`TypedArray`][], [`DataView`][],
[`ArrayBuffer`][] or string as the first argument, an optional second argument
to supply options to the `zlib` classes and will call the supplied callback
with `callback(error, result)`.

Every method has a `*Sync` counterpart, which accept the same arguments, but
without a callback.
