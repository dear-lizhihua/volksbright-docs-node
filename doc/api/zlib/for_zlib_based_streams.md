### For zlib-based streams

From `zlib/zconf.h`, modified for Node.js usage:

The memory requirements for deflate are (in bytes):

<!-- eslint-disable semi -->

```js
(1 << (windowBits + 2)) + (1 << (memLevel + 9))
```

That is: 128K for `windowBits` = 15 + 128K for `memLevel` = 8
(default values) plus a few kilobytes for small objects.

For example, to reduce the default memory requirements from 256K to 128K, the
options should be set to:

```js
const options = { windowBits: 14, memLevel: 7 };
```

This will, however, generally degrade compression.

The memory requirements for inflate are (in bytes) `1 << windowBits`.
That is, 32K for `windowBits` = 15 (default value) plus a few kilobytes
for small objects.

This is in addition to a single internal output slab buffer of size
`chunkSize`, which defaults to 16K.

The speed of `zlib` compression is affected most dramatically by the
`level` setting. A higher level will result in better compression, but
will take longer to complete. A lower level will result in less
compression, but will be much faster.

In general, greater memory usage options will mean that Node.js has to make
fewer calls to `zlib` because it will be able to process more data on
each `write` operation. So, this is another factor that affects the
speed, at the cost of memory usage.
