#### Flush operations

The following values are valid flush operations for Brotli-based streams:

* `zlib.constants.BROTLI_OPERATION_PROCESS` (default for all operations)
* `zlib.constants.BROTLI_OPERATION_FLUSH` (default when calling `.flush()`)
* `zlib.constants.BROTLI_OPERATION_FINISH` (default for the last chunk)
* `zlib.constants.BROTLI_OPERATION_EMIT_METADATA`
  * This particular operation may be hard to use in a Node.js context,
    as the streaming layer makes it hard to know which data will end up
    in this frame. Also, there is currently no way to consume this data through
    the Node.js API.
