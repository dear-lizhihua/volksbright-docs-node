#### `clienthttp2session.request(headers[, options])`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.4.0
-->

* `headers` {HTTP/2 Headers Object}

* `options` {Object}
  * `endStream` {boolean} `true` if the `Http2Stream` _writable_ side should
    be closed initially, such as when sending a `GET` request that should not
    expect a payload body.
  * `exclusive` {boolean} When `true` and `parent` identifies a parent Stream,
    the created stream is made the sole direct dependency of the parent, with
    all other existing dependents made a dependent of the newly created stream.
    **Default:** `false`.
  * `parent` {number} Specifies the numeric identifier of a stream the newly
    created stream is dependent on.
  * `weight` {number} Specifies the relative dependency of a stream in relation
    to other streams with the same `parent`. The value is a number between `1`
    and `256` (inclusive).
  * `waitForTrailers` {boolean} When `true`, the `Http2Stream` will emit the
    `'wantTrailers'` event after the final `DATA` frame has been sent.
  * `signal` {AbortSignal} An AbortSignal that may be used to abort an ongoing
    request.

* Returns: {ClientHttp2Stream}

For HTTP/2 Client `Http2Session` instances only, the `http2session.request()`
creates and returns an `Http2Stream` instance that can be used to send an
HTTP/2 request to the connected server.

When a `ClientHttp2Session` is first created, the socket may not yet be
connected. if `clienthttp2session.request()` is called during this time, the
actual request will be deferred until the socket is ready to go.
If the `session` is closed before the actual request be executed, an
`ERR_HTTP2_GOAWAY_SESSION` is thrown.

This method is only available if `http2session.type` is equal to
`http2.constants.NGHTTP2_SESSION_CLIENT`.

```js
const http2 = require('node:http2');
const clientSession = http2.connect('https://localhost:1234');
const {
  HTTP2_HEADER_PATH,
  HTTP2_HEADER_STATUS,
} = http2.constants;

const req = clientSession.request({ [HTTP2_HEADER_PATH]: '/' });
req.on('response', (headers) => {
  console.log(headers[HTTP2_HEADER_STATUS]);
  req.on('data', (chunk) => { /* .. */ });
  req.on('end', () => { /* .. */ });
});
```

When the `options.waitForTrailers` option is set, the `'wantTrailers'` event
is emitted immediately after queuing the last chunk of payload data to be sent.
The `http2stream.sendTrailers()` method can then be called to send trailing
headers to the peer.

When `options.waitForTrailers` is set, the `Http2Stream` will not automatically
close when the final `DATA` frame is transmitted. User code must call either
`http2stream.sendTrailers()` or `http2stream.close()` to close the
`Http2Stream`.

When `options.signal` is set with an `AbortSignal` and then `abort` on the
corresponding `AbortController` is called, the request will emit an `'error'`
event with an `AbortError` error.

The `:method` and `:path` pseudo-headers are not specified within `headers`,
they respectively default to:

* `:method` = `'GET'`
* `:path` = `/`
