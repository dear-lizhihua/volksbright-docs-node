#### Event: `'close'`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.4.0
-->

The `'close'` event is emitted when the `Http2Stream` is destroyed. Once
this event is emitted, the `Http2Stream` instance is no longer usable.

The HTTP/2 error code used when closing the stream can be retrieved using
the `http2stream.rstCode` property. If the code is any value other than
`NGHTTP2_NO_ERROR` (`0`), an `'error'` event will have also been emitted.
