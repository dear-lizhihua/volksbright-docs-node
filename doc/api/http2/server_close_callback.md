#### `server.close([callback])`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.4.0
-->

* `callback` {Function}

Stops the server from establishing new sessions. This does not prevent new
request streams from being created due to the persistent nature of HTTP/2
sessions. To gracefully shut down the server, call [`http2session.close()`][] on
all active sessions.

If `callback` is provided, it is not invoked until all active sessions have been
closed, although the server has already stopped allowing new sessions. See
[`net.Server.close()`][] for more details.
