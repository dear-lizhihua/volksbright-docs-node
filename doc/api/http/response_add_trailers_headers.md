### `response.addTrailers(headers)`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.0
-->

* `headers` {Object}

This method adds HTTP trailing headers (a header but at the end of the
message) to the response.

Trailers will **only** be emitted if chunked encoding is used for the
response; if it is not (e.g. if the request was HTTP/1.0), they will
be silently discarded.

HTTP requires the `Trailer` header to be sent in order to
emit trailers, with a list of the header fields in its value. E.g.,

```js
response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
                          'Trailer': 'Content-MD5' });
response.write(fileData);
response.addTrailers({ 'Content-MD5': '7895bf4b8828b55ceaf47747b4bca667' });
response.end();
```

Attempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters
will result in a [`TypeError`][] being thrown.
