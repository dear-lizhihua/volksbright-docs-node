### `request.socket`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.0
-->

* {stream.Duplex}

Reference to the underlying socket. Usually users will not want to access
this property. In particular, the socket will not emit `'readable'` events
because of how the protocol parser attaches to the socket.

```js
const http = require('node:http');
const options = {
  host: 'www.google.com',
};
const req = http.get(options);
req.end();
req.once('response', (res) => {
  const ip = req.socket.localAddress;
  const port = req.socket.localPort;
  console.log(`Your IP address is ${ip} and your source port is ${port}.`);
  // Consume response object
});
```

This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the {net.Socket} class,
a subclass of {stream.Duplex}, unless the user specified a socket
type other than {net.Socket}.
