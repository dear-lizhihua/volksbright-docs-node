### `outgoingMessage.flushHeaders()`

<!-- YAML
added: v1.6.0
-->

Flushes the message headers.

For efficiency reason, Node.js normally buffers the message headers
until `outgoingMessage.end()` is called or the first chunk of message data
is written. It then tries to pack the headers and data into a single TCP
packet.

It is usually desired (it saves a TCP round-trip), but not when the first
data is not sent until possibly much later. `outgoingMessage.flushHeaders()`
bypasses the optimization and kickstarts the message.
