### Event: `'checkContinue'`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.0
-->

* `request` {http.IncomingMessage}
* `response` {http.ServerResponse}

Emitted each time a request with an HTTP `Expect: 100-continue` is received.
If this event is not listened for, the server will automatically respond
with a `100 Continue` as appropriate.

Handling this event involves calling [`response.writeContinue()`][] if the
client should continue to send the request body, or generating an appropriate
HTTP response (e.g. 400 Bad Request) if the client should not continue to send
the request body.

When this event is emitted and handled, the [`'request'`][] event will
not be emitted.
