### `outgoingMessage.getHeaders()`

<!-- YAML
added: v7.7.0
-->

* Returns: {Object}

Returns a shallow copy of the current outgoing headers. Since a shallow
copy is used, array values may be mutated without additional calls to
various header-related HTTP module methods. The keys of the returned
object are the header names and the values are the respective header
values. All header names are lowercase.

The object returned by the `outgoingMessage.getHeaders()` method does
not prototypically inherit from the JavaScript `Object`. This means that
typical `Object` methods such as `obj.toString()`, `obj.hasOwnProperty()`,
and others are not defined and will not work.

```js
outgoingMessage.setHeader('Foo', 'bar');
outgoingMessage.setHeader('Set-Cookie', ['foo=bar', 'bar=baz']);

const headers = outgoingMessage.getHeaders();
// headers === { foo: 'bar', 'set-cookie': ['foo=bar', 'bar=baz'] }
```
