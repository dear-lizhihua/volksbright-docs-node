* `chunk` {string|Buffer|Uint8Array}
* `encoding` {string}
* `callback` {Function}
* Returns: {boolean}

Sends a chunk of the body. This method can be called multiple times. If no
`Content-Length` is set, data will automatically be encoded in HTTP Chunked
transfer encoding, so that server knows when the data ends. The
`Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header is added. Calling [`request.end()`][]
is necessary to finish sending the request.

The `encoding` argument is optional and only applies when `chunk` is a string.
Defaults to `'utf8'`.

The `callback` argument is optional and will be called when this chunk of data
is flushed, but only if the chunk is non-empty.

Returns `true` if the entire data was flushed successfully to the kernel
buffer. Returns `false` if all or part of the data was queued in user memory.
`'drain'` will be emitted when the buffer is free again.

When `write` function is called with empty string or buffer, it does
nothing and waits for more input.
