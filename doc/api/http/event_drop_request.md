### Event: `'dropRequest'`

<!-- YAML
added:
  - v18.7.0
  - v16.17.0
-->

* `request` {http.IncomingMessage} Arguments for the HTTP request, as it is in
  the [`'request'`][] event
* `socket` {stream.Duplex} Network socket between the server and client

When the number of requests on a socket reaches the threshold of
`server.maxRequestsPerSocket`, the server will drop new requests
and emit `'dropRequest'` event instead, then send `503` to client.
