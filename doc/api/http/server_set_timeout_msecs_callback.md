* `msecs` {number} **Default:** 0 (no timeout)
* `callback` {Function}
* Returns: {http.Server}

Sets the timeout value for sockets, and emits a `'timeout'` event on
the Server object, passing the socket as an argument, if a timeout
occurs.

If there is a `'timeout'` event listener on the Server object, then it
will be called with the timed-out socket as an argument.

By default, the Server does not timeout sockets. However, if a callback
is assigned to the Server's `'timeout'` event, timeouts must be handled
explicitly.
