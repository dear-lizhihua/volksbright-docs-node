* `error` {Error} Optional, an error to emit with `'error'` event.
* Returns: {this}

Destroy the request. Optionally emit an `'error'` event,
and emit a `'close'` event. Calling this will cause remaining data
in the response to be dropped and the socket to be destroyed.

See [`writable.destroy()`][] for further details.
