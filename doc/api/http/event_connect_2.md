### Event: `'connect'`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.0
-->

* `request` {http.IncomingMessage} Arguments for the HTTP request, as it is in
  the [`'request'`][] event
* `socket` {stream.Duplex} Network socket between the server and client
* `head` {Buffer} The first packet of the tunneling stream (may be empty)

Emitted each time a client requests an HTTP `CONNECT` method. If this event is
not listened for, then clients requesting a `CONNECT` method will have their
connections closed.

This event is guaranteed to be passed an instance of the {net.Socket} class,
a subclass of {stream.Duplex}, unless the user specifies a socket
type other than {net.Socket}.

After this event is emitted, the request's socket will not have a `'data'`
event listener, meaning it will need to be bound in order to handle data
sent to the server on that socket.
