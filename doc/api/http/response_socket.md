### `response.socket`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.0
-->

* {stream.Duplex}

Reference to the underlying socket. Usually users will not want to access
this property. In particular, the socket will not emit `'readable'` events
because of how the protocol parser attaches to the socket. After
`response.end()`, the property is nulled.

```js
const http = require('node:http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const ip = res.socket.remoteAddress;
  const port = res.socket.remotePort;
  res.end(`Your IP address is ${ip} and your source port is ${port}.`);
}).listen(3000);
```

This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the {net.Socket} class,
a subclass of {stream.Duplex}, unless the user specified a socket
type other than {net.Socket}.
