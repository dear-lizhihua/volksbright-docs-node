### `server.keepAliveTimeout`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.0.0
-->

* {number} Timeout in milliseconds. **Default:** `5000` (5 seconds).

The number of milliseconds of inactivity a server needs to wait for additional
incoming data, after it has finished writing the last response, before a socket
will be destroyed. If the server receives new data before the keep-alive
timeout has fired, it will reset the regular inactivity timeout, i.e.,
[`server.timeout`][].

A value of `0` will disable the keep-alive timeout behavior on incoming
connections.
A value of `0` makes the http server behave similarly to Node.js versions prior
to 8.0.0, which did not have a keep-alive timeout.

The socket timeout logic is set up on connection, so changing this value only
affects new connections to the server, not any existing connections.
