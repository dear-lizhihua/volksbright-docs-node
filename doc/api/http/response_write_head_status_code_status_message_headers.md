* `statusCode` {number}
* `statusMessage` {string}
* `headers` {Object|Array}
* Returns: {http.ServerResponse}

Sends a response header to the request. The status code is a 3-digit HTTP
status code, like `404`. The last argument, `headers`, are the response headers.
Optionally one can give a human-readable `statusMessage` as the second
argument.

`headers` may be an `Array` where the keys and values are in the same list.
It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values,
and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. The array is in the same
format as `request.rawHeaders`.

Returns a reference to the `ServerResponse`, so that calls can be chained.

```js
const body = 'hello world';
response
  .writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(body),
    'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
  })
  .end(body);
```

This method must only be called once on a message and it must
be called before [`response.end()`][] is called.

If [`response.write()`][] or [`response.end()`][] are called before calling
this, the implicit/mutable headers will be calculated and call this function.

When headers have been set with [`response.setHeader()`][], they will be merged
with any headers passed to [`response.writeHead()`][], with the headers passed
to [`response.writeHead()`][] given precedence.

If this method is called and [`response.setHeader()`][] has not been called,
it will directly write the supplied header values onto the network channel
without caching internally, and the [`response.getHeader()`][] on the header
will not yield the expected result. If progressive population of headers is
desired with potential future retrieval and modification, use
[`response.setHeader()`][] instead.

```js
// Returns content-type = text/plain
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  res.setHeader('X-Foo', 'bar');
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('ok');
});
```

`Content-Length` is read in bytes, not characters. Use
[`Buffer.byteLength()`][] to determine the length of the body in bytes. Node.js
will check whether `Content-Length` and the length of the body which has
been transmitted are equal or not.

Attempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters
will result in a \[`Error`]\[] being thrown.
