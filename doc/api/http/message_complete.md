### `message.complete`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.0
-->

* {boolean}

The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has
been received and successfully parsed.

This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or
server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated:

```js
const req = http.request({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 8080,
  method: 'POST',
}, (res) => {
  res.resume();
  res.on('end', () => {
    if (!res.complete)
      console.error(
        'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent');
  });
});
```
