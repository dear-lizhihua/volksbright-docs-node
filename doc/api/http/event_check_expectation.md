### Event: `'checkExpectation'`

<!-- YAML
added: v5.5.0
-->

* `request` {http.IncomingMessage}
* `response` {http.ServerResponse}

Emitted each time a request with an HTTP `Expect` header is received, where the
value is not `100-continue`. If this event is not listened for, the server will
automatically respond with a `417 Expectation Failed` as appropriate.

When this event is emitted and handled, the [`'request'`][] event will
not be emitted.
