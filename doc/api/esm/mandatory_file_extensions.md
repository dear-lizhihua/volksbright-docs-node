### Mandatory file extensions

A file extension must be provided when using the `import` keyword to resolve
relative or absolute specifiers. Directory indexes (e.g. `'./startup/index.js'`)
must also be fully specified.

This behavior matches how `import` behaves in browser environments, assuming a
typically configured server.
