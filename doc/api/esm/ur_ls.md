### URLs

ES modules are resolved and cached as URLs. This means that special characters
must be [percent-encoded][], such as `#` with `%23` and `?` with `%3F`.

`file:`, `node:`, and `data:` URL schemes are supported. A specifier like
`'https://example.com/app.js'` is not supported natively in Node.js unless using
a [custom HTTPS loader][].
