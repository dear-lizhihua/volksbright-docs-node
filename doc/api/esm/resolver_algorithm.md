### Resolver algorithm

The algorithm to load an ES module specifier is given through the
**ESM\_RESOLVE** method below. It returns the resolved URL for a
module specifier relative to a parentURL.

The algorithm to determine the module format of a resolved URL is
provided by **ESM\_FORMAT**, which returns the unique module
format for any file. The _"module"_ format is returned for an ECMAScript
Module, while the _"commonjs"_ format is used to indicate loading through the
legacy CommonJS loader. Additional formats such as _"addon"_ can be extended in
future updates.

In the following algorithms, all subroutine errors are propagated as errors
of these top-level routines unless stated otherwise.

_defaultConditions_ is the conditional environment name array,
`["node", "import"]`.

The resolver can throw the following errors:

* _Invalid Module Specifier_: Module specifier is an invalid URL, package name
  or package subpath specifier.
* _Invalid Package Configuration_: package.json configuration is invalid or
  contains an invalid configuration.
* _Invalid Package Target_: Package exports or imports define a target module
  for the package that is an invalid type or string target.
* _Package Path Not Exported_: Package exports do not define or permit a target
  subpath in the package for the given module.
* _Package Import Not Defined_: Package imports do not define the specifier.
* _Module Not Found_: The package or module requested does not exist.
* _Unsupported Directory Import_: The resolved path corresponds to a directory,
  which is not a supported target for module imports.
