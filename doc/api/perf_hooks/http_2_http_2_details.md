### HTTP/2 ('http2') Details

When `performanceEntry.type` is equal to `'http2'`, the
`performanceNodeEntry.detail` property will be an {Object} containing
additional performance information.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `Http2Stream`, the `detail`
will contain the following properties:

* `bytesRead` {number} The number of `DATA` frame bytes received for this
  `Http2Stream`.
* `bytesWritten` {number} The number of `DATA` frame bytes sent for this
  `Http2Stream`.
* `id` {number} The identifier of the associated `Http2Stream`
* `timeToFirstByte` {number} The number of milliseconds elapsed between the
  `PerformanceEntry` `startTime` and the reception of the first `DATA` frame.
* `timeToFirstByteSent` {number} The number of milliseconds elapsed between
  the `PerformanceEntry` `startTime` and sending of the first `DATA` frame.
* `timeToFirstHeader` {number} The number of milliseconds elapsed between the
  `PerformanceEntry` `startTime` and the reception of the first header.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `Http2Session`, the `detail` will
contain the following properties:

* `bytesRead` {number} The number of bytes received for this `Http2Session`.
* `bytesWritten` {number} The number of bytes sent for this `Http2Session`.
* `framesReceived` {number} The number of HTTP/2 frames received by the
  `Http2Session`.
* `framesSent` {number} The number of HTTP/2 frames sent by the `Http2Session`.
* `maxConcurrentStreams` {number} The maximum number of streams concurrently
  open during the lifetime of the `Http2Session`.
* `pingRTT` {number} The number of milliseconds elapsed since the transmission
  of a `PING` frame and the reception of its acknowledgment. Only present if
  a `PING` frame has been sent on the `Http2Session`.
* `streamAverageDuration` {number} The average duration (in milliseconds) for
  all `Http2Stream` instances.
* `streamCount` {number} The number of `Http2Stream` instances processed by
  the `Http2Session`.
* `type` {string} Either `'server'` or `'client'` to identify the type of
  `Http2Session`.
