* {number}

The high resolution millisecond timestamp of the amount of time the event loop
has been idle within the event loop's event provider (e.g. `epoll_wait`). This
does not take CPU usage into consideration. If the event loop has not yet
started (e.g., in the first tick of the main script), the property has the
value of 0.
