### `performance.eventLoopUtilization([utilization1[, utilization2]])`

<!-- YAML
added:

* `utilization1` {Object} The result of a previous call to
  `eventLoopUtilization()`.
* `utilization2` {Object} The result of a previous call to
  `eventLoopUtilization()` prior to `utilization1`.
* Returns {Object}
  * `idle` {number}
  * `active` {number}
  * `utilization` {number}

The `eventLoopUtilization()` method returns an object that contains the
cumulative duration of time the event loop has been both idle and active as a
high resolution milliseconds timer. The `utilization` value is the calculated
Event Loop Utilization (ELU).

If bootstrapping has not yet finished on the main thread the properties have
the value of `0`. The ELU is immediately available on [Worker threads][] since
bootstrap happens within the event loop.

Both `utilization1` and `utilization2` are optional parameters.

If `utilization1` is passed, then the delta between the current call's `active`
and `idle` times, as well as the corresponding `utilization` value are
calculated and returned (similar to [`process.hrtime()`][]).

If `utilization1` and `utilization2` are both passed, then the delta is
calculated between the two arguments. This is a convenience option because,
unlike [`process.hrtime()`][], calculating the ELU is more complex than a
single subtraction.

ELU is similar to CPU utilization, except that it only measures event loop
statistics and not CPU usage. It represents the percentage of time the event
loop has spent outside the event loop's event provider (e.g. `epoll_wait`).
No other CPU idle time is taken into consideration. The following is an example
of how a mostly idle process will have a high ELU.

```js
'use strict';
const { eventLoopUtilization } = require('node:perf_hooks').performance;
const { spawnSync } = require('node:child_process');

setImmediate(() => {
  const elu = eventLoopUtilization();
  spawnSync('sleep', ['5']);
  console.log(eventLoopUtilization(elu).utilization);
});
```

Although the CPU is mostly idle while running this script, the value of
`utilization` is `1`. This is because the call to
[`child_process.spawnSync()`][] blocks the event loop from proceeding.

Passing in a user-defined object instead of the result of a previous call to
`eventLoopUtilization()` will lead to undefined behavior. The return values
are not guaranteed to reflect any correct state of the event loop.
