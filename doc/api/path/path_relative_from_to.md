* `from` {string}
* `to` {string}
* Returns: {string}

The `path.relative()` method returns the relative path from `from` to `to` based
on the current working directory. If `from` and `to` each resolve to the same
path (after calling `path.resolve()` on each), a zero-length string is returned.

If a zero-length string is passed as `from` or `to`, the current working
directory will be used instead of the zero-length strings.

For example, on POSIX:

```js
path.relative('/data/orandea/test/aaa', '/data/orandea/impl/bbb');
// Returns: '../../impl/bbb'
```

On Windows:

```js
path.relative('C:\\orandea\\test\\aaa', 'C:\\orandea\\impl\\bbb');
// Returns: '..\\..\\impl\\bbb'
```

A [`TypeError`][] is thrown if either `from` or `to` is not a string.
