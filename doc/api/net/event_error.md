### Event: `'error'`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.90
-->

* {Error}

Emitted when an error occurs. Unlike [`net.Socket`][], the [`'close'`][]
event will **not** be emitted directly following this event unless
[`server.close()`][] is manually called. See the example in discussion of
[`server.listen()`][].
