### `socket.ref()`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.9.1
-->

* Returns: {net.Socket} The socket itself.

Opposite of `unref()`, calling `ref()` on a previously `unref`ed socket will
_not_ let the program exit if it's the only socket left (the default behavior).
If the socket is `ref`ed calling `ref` again will have no effect.
