    description: New defaults for `TCP_KEEPCNT` and `TCP_KEEPINTVL` socket options were added.
-->

* `enable` {boolean} **Default:** `false`
* `initialDelay` {number} **Default:** `0`
* Returns: {net.Socket} The socket itself.

Enable/disable keep-alive functionality, and optionally set the initial
delay before the first keepalive probe is sent on an idle socket.

Set `initialDelay` (in milliseconds) to set the delay between the last
data packet received and the first keepalive probe. Setting `0` for
`initialDelay` will leave the value unchanged from the default
(or previous) setting.

Enabling the keep-alive functionality will set the following socket options:

* `SO_KEEPALIVE=1`
* `TCP_KEEPIDLE=initialDelay`
* `TCP_KEEPCNT=10`
* `TCP_KEEPINTVL=1`
