### `console.profileEnd([label])`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.0.0
-->

* `label` {string}

This method does not display anything unless used in the inspector. Stops the
current JavaScript CPU profiling session if one has been started and prints
the report to the **Profiles** panel of the inspector. See
[`console.profile()`][] for an example.

If this method is called without a label, the most recently started profile is
stopped.
