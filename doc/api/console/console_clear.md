### `console.clear()`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.3.0
-->

When `stdout` is a TTY, calling `console.clear()` will attempt to clear the
TTY. When `stdout` is not a TTY, this method does nothing.

The specific operation of `console.clear()` can vary across operating systems
and terminal types. For most Linux operating systems, `console.clear()`
operates similarly to the `clear` shell command. On Windows, `console.clear()`
will clear only the output in the current terminal viewport for the Node.js
binary.
