##### `readable.pause()`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.9.4
-->

* Returns: {this}

The `readable.pause()` method will cause a stream in flowing mode to stop
emitting [`'data'`][] events, switching out of flowing mode. Any data that
becomes available will remain in the internal buffer.

```js
const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
  readable.pause();
  console.log('There will be no additional data for 1 second.');
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Now data will start flowing again.');
    readable.resume();
  }, 1000);
});
```

The `readable.pause()` method has no effect if there is a `'readable'`
event listener.
