##### `writable.uncork()`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.11.2
-->

The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since
[`stream.cork()`][] was called.

When using [`writable.cork()`][] and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering
of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using
`process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all
`writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

```js
stream.cork();
stream.write('some ');
stream.write('data ');
process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
```

If the [`writable.cork()`][] method is called multiple times on a stream, the
same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered
data.

```js
stream.cork();
stream.write('some ');
stream.cork();
stream.write('data ');
process.nextTick(() => {
  stream.uncork();
  // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
  stream.uncork();
});
```
