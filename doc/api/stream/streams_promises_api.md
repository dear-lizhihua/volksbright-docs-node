### Streams Promises API

<!-- YAML
added: v15.0.0
-->

The `stream/promises` API provides an alternative set of asynchronous utility
functions for streams that return `Promise` objects rather than using
callbacks. The API is accessible via `require('node:stream/promises')`
or `require('node:stream').promises`.
