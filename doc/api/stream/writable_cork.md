##### `writable.cork()`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.11.2
-->

The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory.
The buffered data will be flushed when either the [`stream.uncork()`][] or
[`stream.end()`][stream-end] methods are called.

The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which
several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of
immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()`
buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them
all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking
situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk
to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing
`writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.
