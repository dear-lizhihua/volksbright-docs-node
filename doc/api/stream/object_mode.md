### Object mode

All streams created by Node.js APIs operate exclusively on strings and `Buffer`
(or `Uint8Array`) objects. It is possible, however, for stream implementations
to work with other types of JavaScript values (with the exception of `null`,
which serves a special purpose within streams). Such streams are considered to
operate in "object mode".

Stream instances are switched into object mode using the `objectMode` option
when the stream is created. Attempting to switch an existing stream into
object mode is not safe.
