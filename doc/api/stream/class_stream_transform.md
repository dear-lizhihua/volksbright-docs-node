Transform streams are [`Duplex`][] streams where the output is in some way
related to the input. Like all [`Duplex`][] streams, `Transform` streams
implement both the [`Readable`][] and [`Writable`][] interfaces.

Examples of `Transform` streams include:

* [zlib streams][zlib]
* [crypto streams][crypto]
