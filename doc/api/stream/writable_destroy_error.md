    description: Work as a no-op on a stream that has already been destroyed.
-->

* `error` {Error} Optional, an error to emit with `'error'` event.
* Returns: {this}

Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'`
event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the writable
stream has ended and subsequent calls to `write()` or `end()` will result in
an `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED` error.
This is a destructive and immediate way to destroy a stream. Previous calls to
`write()` may not have drained, and may trigger an `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED` error.
Use `end()` instead of destroy if data should flush before close, or wait for
the `'drain'` event before destroying the stream.

```cjs
const { Writable } = require('node:stream');

const myStream = new Writable();

const fooErr = new Error('foo error');
myStream.destroy(fooErr);
myStream.on('error', (fooErr) => console.error(fooErr.message)); // foo error
```

```cjs
const { Writable } = require('node:stream');

const myStream = new Writable();

myStream.destroy();
myStream.on('error', function wontHappen() {});
```

```cjs
const { Writable } = require('node:stream');

const myStream = new Writable();
myStream.destroy();

myStream.write('foo', (error) => console.error(error.code));
// ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED
```

Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no
further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

Implementors should not override this method,
but instead implement [`writable._destroy()`][writable-_destroy].
