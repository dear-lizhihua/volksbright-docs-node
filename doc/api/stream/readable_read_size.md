##### `readable.read([size])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.9.4
-->

* `size` {number} Optional argument to specify how much data to read.
* Returns: {string|Buffer|null|any}

The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and
returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default,
the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been
specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating
in object mode.

The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If
`size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned _unless_
the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal
buffer will be returned.

If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the
internal buffer will be returned.

The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams
operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called
automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

```js
const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

// 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
readable.on('readable', () => {
  let chunk;
  console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
  // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
  while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
    console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
  }
});

// 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
readable.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Reached end of stream.');
});
```

Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks
are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data
currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`,
having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to
come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted
when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be
emitted when there is no more data to come.

Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary
to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

```js
const chunks = [];

readable.on('readable', () => {
  let chunk;
  while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
    chunks.push(chunk);
  }
});

readable.on('end', () => {
  const content = chunks.join('');
});
```

A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from
a call to [`readable.read(size)`][stream-read], regardless of the value of the
`size` argument.

If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will
also be emitted.

Calling [`stream.read([size])`][stream-read] after the [`'end'`][] event has
been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.
