##### `readable.unpipe([destination])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.9.4
-->

* `destination` {stream.Writable} Optional specific stream to unpipe
* Returns: {this}

The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached
using the [`stream.pipe()`][] method.

If the `destination` is not specified, then _all_ pipes are detached.

If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then
the method does nothing.

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');
const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
// All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
// but only for the first second.
readable.pipe(writable);
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
  readable.unpipe(writable);
  console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
  writable.end();
}, 1000);
```
