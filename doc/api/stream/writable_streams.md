### Writable streams

Writable streams are an abstraction for a _destination_ to which data is
written.

Examples of [`Writable`][] streams include:

* [HTTP requests, on the client][]
* [HTTP responses, on the server][]
* [fs write streams][]
* [zlib streams][zlib]
* [crypto streams][crypto]
* [TCP sockets][]
* [child process stdin][]
* [`process.stdout`][], [`process.stderr`][]

Some of these examples are actually [`Duplex`][] streams that implement the
[`Writable`][] interface.

All [`Writable`][] streams implement the interface defined by the
`stream.Writable` class.

While specific instances of [`Writable`][] streams may differ in various ways,
all `Writable` streams follow the same fundamental usage pattern as illustrated
in the example below:

```js
const myStream = getWritableStreamSomehow();
myStream.write('some data');
myStream.write('some more data');
myStream.end('done writing data');
```
