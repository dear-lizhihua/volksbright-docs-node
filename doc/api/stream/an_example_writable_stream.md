#### An example writable stream

The following illustrates a rather simplistic (and somewhat pointless) custom
`Writable` stream implementation. While this specific `Writable` stream instance
is not of any real particular usefulness, the example illustrates each of the
required elements of a custom [`Writable`][] stream instance:

```js
const { Writable } = require('node:stream');

class MyWritable extends Writable {
  _write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    if (chunk.toString().indexOf('a') >= 0) {
      callback(new Error('chunk is invalid'));
    } else {
      callback();
    }
  }
}
```
