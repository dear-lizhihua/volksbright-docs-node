# Permissions

Permissions can be used to control what system resources the
Node.js process has access to or what actions the process can take
with those resources. Permissions can also control what modules can
be accessed by other modules.

* [Module-based permissions](#module-based-permissions) control which files
  or URLs are available to other modules during application execution.
  This can be used to control what modules can be accessed by third-party
  dependencies, for example.

If you find a potential security vulnerability, please refer to our
[Security Policy][].
