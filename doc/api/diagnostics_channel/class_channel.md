### Class: `Channel`

<!-- YAML
added:
 - v15.1.0
 - v14.17.0
-->

The class `Channel` represents an individual named channel within the data
pipeline. It is used to track subscribers and to publish messages when there
are subscribers present. It exists as a separate object to avoid channel
lookups at publish time, enabling very fast publish speeds and allowing
for heavy use while incurring very minimal cost. Channels are created with
[`diagnostics_channel.channel(name)`][], constructing a channel directly
with `new Channel(name)` is not supported.
