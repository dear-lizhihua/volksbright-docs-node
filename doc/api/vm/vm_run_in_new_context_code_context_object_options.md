-->

* `code` {string} The JavaScript code to compile and run.
* `contextObject` {Object} An object that will be [contextified][]. If
  `undefined`, a new object will be created.
* `options` {Object|string}
  * `filename` {string} Specifies the filename used in stack traces produced
    by this script. **Default:** `'evalmachine.<anonymous>'`.
  * `lineOffset` {number} Specifies the line number offset that is displayed
    in stack traces produced by this script. **Default:** `0`.
  * `columnOffset` {number} Specifies the first-line column number offset that
    is displayed in stack traces produced by this script. **Default:** `0`.
  * `displayErrors` {boolean} When `true`, if an [`Error`][] occurs
    while compiling the `code`, the line of code causing the error is attached
    to the stack trace. **Default:** `true`.
  * `timeout` {integer} Specifies the number of milliseconds to execute `code`
    before terminating execution. If execution is terminated, an [`Error`][]
    will be thrown. This value must be a strictly positive integer.
  * `breakOnSigint` {boolean} If `true`, receiving `SIGINT`
    (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) will terminate execution and throw an
    [`Error`][]. Existing handlers for the event that have been attached via
    `process.on('SIGINT')` are disabled during script execution, but continue to
    work after that. **Default:** `false`.
  * `contextName` {string} Human-readable name of the newly created context.
    **Default:** `'VM Context i'`, where `i` is an ascending numerical index of
    the created context.
  * `contextOrigin` {string} [Origin][origin] corresponding to the newly
    created context for display purposes. The origin should be formatted like a
    URL, but with only the scheme, host, and port (if necessary), like the
    value of the [`url.origin`][] property of a [`URL`][] object. Most notably,
    this string should omit the trailing slash, as that denotes a path.
    **Default:** `''`.
  * `contextCodeGeneration` {Object}
    * `strings` {boolean} If set to false any calls to `eval` or function
      constructors (`Function`, `GeneratorFunction`, etc) will throw an
      `EvalError`. **Default:** `true`.
    * `wasm` {boolean} If set to false any attempt to compile a WebAssembly
      module will throw a `WebAssembly.CompileError`. **Default:** `true`.
  * `cachedData` {Buffer|TypedArray|DataView} Provides an optional `Buffer` or
    `TypedArray`, or `DataView` with V8's code cache data for the supplied
    source.
  * `importModuleDynamically` {Function} Called during evaluation of this module
    when `import()` is called. If this option is not specified, calls to
    `import()` will reject with [`ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING`][].
    This option is part of the experimental modules API. We do not recommend
    using it in a production environment.
    * `specifier` {string} specifier passed to `import()`
    * `script` {vm.Script}
    * `importAssertions` {Object} The `"assert"` value passed to the
      [`optionsExpression`][] optional parameter, or an empty object if no value
      was provided.
    * Returns: {Module Namespace Object|vm.Module} Returning a `vm.Module` is
      recommended in order to take advantage of error tracking, and to avoid
      issues with namespaces that contain `then` function exports.
  * `microtaskMode` {string} If set to `afterEvaluate`, microtasks (tasks
    scheduled through `Promise`s and `async function`s) will be run immediately
    after the script has run. They are included in the `timeout` and
    `breakOnSigint` scopes in that case.
* Returns: {any} the result of the very last statement executed in the script.

The `vm.runInNewContext()` first contextifies the given `contextObject` (or
creates a new `contextObject` if passed as `undefined`), compiles the `code`,
runs it within the created context, then returns the result. Running code
does not have access to the local scope.

If `options` is a string, then it specifies the filename.

The following example compiles and executes code that increments a global
variable and sets a new one. These globals are contained in the `contextObject`.

```js
const vm = require('node:vm');

const contextObject = {
  animal: 'cat',
  count: 2,
};

vm.runInNewContext('count += 1; name = "kitty"', contextObject);
console.log(contextObject);
// Prints: { animal: 'cat', count: 3, name: 'kitty' }
```
