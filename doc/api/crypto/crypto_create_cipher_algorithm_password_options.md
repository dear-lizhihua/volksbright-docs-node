* `algorithm` {string}
* `password` {string|ArrayBuffer|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView}
* `options` {Object} [`stream.transform` options][]
* Returns: {Cipher}

Creates and returns a `Cipher` object that uses the given `algorithm` and
`password`.

The `options` argument controls stream behavior and is optional except when a
cipher in CCM or OCB mode (e.g. `'aes-128-ccm'`) is used. In that case, the
`authTagLength` option is required and specifies the length of the
authentication tag in bytes, see [CCM mode][]. In GCM mode, the `authTagLength`
option is not required but can be used to set the length of the authentication
tag that will be returned by `getAuthTag()` and defaults to 16 bytes.
For `chacha20-poly1305`, the `authTagLength` option defaults to 16 bytes.

The `algorithm` is dependent on OpenSSL, examples are `'aes192'`, etc. On
recent OpenSSL releases, `openssl list -cipher-algorithms` will
display the available cipher algorithms.

The `password` is used to derive the cipher key and initialization vector (IV).
The value must be either a `'latin1'` encoded string, a [`Buffer`][], a
`TypedArray`, or a `DataView`.

<strong class="critical">This function is semantically insecure for all
supported ciphers and fatally flawed for ciphers in counter mode (such as CTR,
GCM, or CCM).</strong>

The implementation of `crypto.createCipher()` derives keys using the OpenSSL
function [`EVP_BytesToKey`][] with the digest algorithm set to MD5, one
iteration, and no salt. The lack of salt allows dictionary attacks as the same
password always creates the same key. The low iteration count and
non-cryptographically secure hash algorithm allow passwords to be tested very
rapidly.

In line with OpenSSL's recommendation to use a more modern algorithm instead of
[`EVP_BytesToKey`][] it is recommended that developers derive a key and IV on
their own using [`crypto.scrypt()`][] and to use [`crypto.createCipheriv()`][]
to create the `Cipher` object. Users should not use ciphers with counter mode
(e.g. CTR, GCM, or CCM) in `crypto.createCipher()`. A warning is emitted when
they are used in order to avoid the risk of IV reuse that causes
vulnerabilities. For the case when IV is reused in GCM, see [Nonce-Disrespecting
Adversaries][] for details.
