types are:

* `'rsa'` (OID 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1)
* `'rsa-pss'` (OID 1.2.840.113549.1.1.10)
* `'dsa'` (OID 1.2.840.10040.4.1)
* `'ec'` (OID 1.2.840.10045.2.1)
* `'x25519'` (OID 1.3.101.110)
* `'x448'` (OID 1.3.101.111)
* `'ed25519'` (OID 1.3.101.112)
* `'ed448'` (OID 1.3.101.113)
* `'dh'` (OID 1.2.840.113549.1.3.1)

This property is `undefined` for unrecognized `KeyObject` types and symmetric
keys.
