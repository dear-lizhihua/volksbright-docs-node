* `a` {ArrayBuffer|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView}
* `b` {ArrayBuffer|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView}
* Returns: {boolean}

This function compares the underlying bytes that represent the given
`ArrayBuffer`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView` instances using a constant-time
algorithm.

This function does not leak timing information that
would allow an attacker to guess one of the values. This is suitable for
comparing HMAC digests or secret values like authentication cookies or
[capability urls](https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/).

`a` and `b` must both be `Buffer`s, `TypedArray`s, or `DataView`s, and they
must have the same byte length. An error is thrown if `a` and `b` have
different byte lengths.

If at least one of `a` and `b` is a `TypedArray` with more than one byte per
entry, such as `Uint16Array`, the result will be computed using the platform
byte order.

<strong class="critical">When both of the inputs are `Float32Array`s or
`Float64Array`s, this function might return unexpected results due to IEEE 754
encoding of floating-point numbers. In particular, neither `x === y` nor
`Object.is(x, y)` implies that the byte representations of two floating-point
numbers `x` and `y` are equal.</strong>

Use of `crypto.timingSafeEqual` does not guarantee that the _surrounding_ code
is timing-safe. Care should be taken to ensure that the surrounding code does
not introduce timing vulnerabilities.
