* `data` {string|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView}
* `inputEncoding` {string} The [encoding][] of the `data` string.

Updates the `Verify` content with the given `data`, the encoding of which
is given in `inputEncoding`.
If `inputEncoding` is not provided, and the `data` is a string, an
encoding of `'utf8'` is enforced. If `data` is a [`Buffer`][], `TypedArray`, or
`DataView`, then `inputEncoding` is ignored.

This can be called many times with new data as it is streamed.
