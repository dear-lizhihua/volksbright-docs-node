### CCM mode

CCM is one of the supported [AEAD algorithms][]. Applications which use this
mode must adhere to certain restrictions when using the cipher API:

* The authentication tag length must be specified during cipher creation by
  setting the `authTagLength` option and must be one of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 or
  16 bytes.
* The length of the initialization vector (nonce) `N` must be between 7 and 13
  bytes (`7 ≤ N ≤ 13`).
* The length of the plaintext is limited to `2 ** (8 * (15 - N))` bytes.
* When decrypting, the authentication tag must be set via `setAuthTag()` before
  calling `update()`.
  Otherwise, decryption will fail and `final()` will throw an error in
  compliance with section 2.6 of [RFC 3610][].
* Using stream methods such as `write(data)`, `end(data)` or `pipe()` in CCM
  mode might fail as CCM cannot handle more than one chunk of data per instance.
* When passing additional authenticated data (AAD), the length of the actual
  message in bytes must be passed to `setAAD()` via the `plaintextLength`
  option.
  Many crypto libraries include the authentication tag in the ciphertext,
  which means that they produce ciphertexts of the length
  `plaintextLength + authTagLength`. Node.js does not include the authentication
  tag, so the ciphertext length is always `plaintextLength`.
  This is not necessary if no AAD is used.
* As CCM processes the whole message at once, `update()` must be called exactly
  once.
* Even though calling `update()` is sufficient to encrypt/decrypt the message,
  applications _must_ call `final()` to compute or verify the
  authentication tag.
