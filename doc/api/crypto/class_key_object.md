Node.js uses a `KeyObject` class to represent a symmetric or asymmetric key,
and each kind of key exposes different functions. The
[`crypto.createSecretKey()`][], [`crypto.createPublicKey()`][] and
[`crypto.createPrivateKey()`][] methods are used to create `KeyObject`
instances. `KeyObject` objects are not to be created directly using the `new`
keyword.

Most applications should consider using the new `KeyObject` API instead of
passing keys as strings or `Buffer`s due to improved security features.

`KeyObject` instances can be passed to other threads via [`postMessage()`][].
The receiver obtains a cloned `KeyObject`, and the `KeyObject` does not need to
be listed in the `transferList` argument.
