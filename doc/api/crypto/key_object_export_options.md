* `options`: {Object}
* Returns: {string | Buffer | Object}

For symmetric keys, the following encoding options can be used:

* `format`: {string} Must be `'buffer'` (default) or `'jwk'`.

For public keys, the following encoding options can be used:

* `type`: {string} Must be one of `'pkcs1'` (RSA only) or `'spki'`.
* `format`: {string} Must be `'pem'`, `'der'`, or `'jwk'`.

For private keys, the following encoding options can be used:

* `type`: {string} Must be one of `'pkcs1'` (RSA only), `'pkcs8'` or
  `'sec1'` (EC only).
* `format`: {string} Must be `'pem'`, `'der'`, or `'jwk'`.
* `cipher`: {string} If specified, the private key will be encrypted with
  the given `cipher` and `passphrase` using PKCS#5 v2.0 password based
  encryption.
* `passphrase`: {string | Buffer} The passphrase to use for encryption, see
  `cipher`.

The result type depends on the selected encoding format, when PEM the
result is a string, when DER it will be a buffer containing the data
encoded as DER, when [JWK][] it will be an object.

When [JWK][] encoding format was selected, all other encoding options are
ignored.

PKCS#1, SEC1, and PKCS#8 type keys can be encrypted by using a combination of
the `cipher` and `format` options. The PKCS#8 `type` can be used with any
`format` to encrypt any key algorithm (RSA, EC, or DH) by specifying a
`cipher`. PKCS#1 and SEC1 can only be encrypted by specifying a `cipher`
when the PEM `format` is used. For maximum compatibility, use PKCS#8 for
encrypted private keys. Since PKCS#8 defines its own
encryption mechanism, PEM-level encryption is not supported when encrypting
a PKCS#8 key. See [RFC 5208][] for PKCS#8 encryption and [RFC 1421][] for
PKCS#1 and SEC1 encryption.
