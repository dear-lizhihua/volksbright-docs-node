### Using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs

For historical reasons, many cryptographic APIs provided by Node.js accept
strings as inputs where the underlying cryptographic algorithm works on byte
sequences. These instances include plaintexts, ciphertexts, symmetric keys,
initialization vectors, passphrases, salts, authentication tags,
and additional authenticated data.

When passing strings to cryptographic APIs, consider the following factors.

* Not all byte sequences are valid UTF-8 strings. Therefore, when a byte
  sequence of length `n` is derived from a string, its entropy is generally
  lower than the entropy of a random or pseudorandom `n` byte sequence.
  For example, no UTF-8 string will result in the byte sequence `c0 af`. Secret
  keys should almost exclusively be random or pseudorandom byte sequences.
* Similarly, when converting random or pseudorandom byte sequences to UTF-8
  strings, subsequences that do not represent valid code points may be replaced
  by the Unicode replacement character (`U+FFFD`). The byte representation of
  the resulting Unicode string may, therefore, not be equal to the byte sequence
  that the string was created from.

  ```js
  const original = [0xc0, 0xaf];
  const bytesAsString = Buffer.from(original).toString('utf8');
  const stringAsBytes = Buffer.from(bytesAsString, 'utf8');
  console.log(stringAsBytes);
  // Prints '<Buffer ef bf bd ef bf bd>'.
  ```

  The outputs of ciphers, hash functions, signature algorithms, and key
  derivation functions are pseudorandom byte sequences and should not be
  used as Unicode strings.
* When strings are obtained from user input, some Unicode characters can be
  represented in multiple equivalent ways that result in different byte
  sequences. For example, when passing a user passphrase to a key derivation
  function, such as PBKDF2 or scrypt, the result of the key derivation function
  depends on whether the string uses composed or decomposed characters. Node.js
  does not normalize character representations. Developers should consider using
  [`String.prototype.normalize()`][] on user inputs before passing them to
  cryptographic APIs.
