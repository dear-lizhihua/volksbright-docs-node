-->

* `name` {string} The name of the test, which is displayed when reporting test
  results. **Default:** The `name` property of `fn`, or `'<anonymous>'` if `fn`
  does not have a name.
* `options` {Object} Configuration options for the test. The following
  properties are supported:
  * `concurrency` {number|boolean} If a number is provided,
    then that many tests would run in parallel.
    If truthy, it would run (number of cpu cores - 1)
    tests in parallel.
    For subtests, it will be `Infinity` tests in parallel.
    If falsy, it would only run one test at a time.
    If unspecified, subtests inherit this value from their parent.
    **Default:** `false`.
  * `only` {boolean} If truthy, and the test context is configured to run
    `only` tests, then this test will be run. Otherwise, the test is skipped.
    **Default:** `false`.
  * `signal` {AbortSignal} Allows aborting an in-progress test.
  * `skip` {boolean|string} If truthy, the test is skipped. If a string is
    provided, that string is displayed in the test results as the reason for
    skipping the test. **Default:** `false`.
  * `todo` {boolean|string} If truthy, the test marked as `TODO`. If a string
    is provided, that string is displayed in the test results as the reason why
    the test is `TODO`. **Default:** `false`.
  * `timeout` {number} A number of milliseconds the test will fail after.
    If unspecified, subtests inherit this value from their parent.
    **Default:** `Infinity`.
* `fn` {Function|AsyncFunction} The function under test. The first argument
  to this function is a [`TestContext`][] object. If the test uses callbacks,
  the callback function is passed as the second argument. **Default:** A no-op
  function.
* Returns: {Promise} Resolved with `undefined` once the test completes.

The `test()` function is the value imported from the `test` module. Each
invocation of this function results in reporting the test to the {TestsStream}.

The `TestContext` object passed to the `fn` argument can be used to perform
actions related to the current test. Examples include skipping the test, adding
additional diagnostic information, or creating subtests.

`test()` returns a `Promise` that resolves once the test completes. The return
value can usually be discarded for top level tests. However, the return value
from subtests should be used to prevent the parent test from finishing first
and cancelling the subtest as shown in the following example.

```js
test('top level test', async (t) => {
  // The setTimeout() in the following subtest would cause it to outlive its
  // parent test if 'await' is removed on the next line. Once the parent test
  // completes, it will cancel any outstanding subtests.
  await t.test('longer running subtest', async (t) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(resolve, 1000);
    });
  });
});
```

The `timeout` option can be used to fail the test if it takes longer than
`timeout` milliseconds to complete. However, it is not a reliable mechanism for
canceling tests because a running test might block the application thread and
thus prevent the scheduled cancellation.
