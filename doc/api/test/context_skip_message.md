### `context.skip([message])`

<!-- YAML
added:

* `message` {string} Optional skip message.

This function causes the test's output to indicate the test as skipped. If
`message` is provided, it is included in the output. Calling `skip()` does
not terminate execution of the test function. This function does not return a
value.

```js
test('top level test', (t) => {
  // Make sure to return here as well if the test contains additional logic.
  t.skip('this is skipped');
});
```
