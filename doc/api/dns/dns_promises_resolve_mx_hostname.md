### `dnsPromises.resolveMx(hostname)`

<!-- YAML
added: v10.6.0
-->

* `hostname` {string}

Uses the DNS protocol to resolve mail exchange records (`MX` records) for the
`hostname`. On success, the `Promise` is resolved with an array of objects
containing both a `priority` and `exchange` property (e.g.
`[{priority: 10, exchange: 'mx.example.com'}, ...]`).
