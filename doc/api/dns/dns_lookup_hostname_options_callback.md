    description: For compatibility with `node:net`, when passing an option
                 object the `family` option can be the string `'IPv4'` or the
                 string `'IPv6'`.

    description: Passing an invalid callback to the `callback` argument
                 now throws `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` instead of
                 `ERR_INVALID_CALLBACK`.

* `hostname` {string}
* `options` {integer | Object}
  * `family` {integer|string} The record family. Must be `4`, `6`, or `0`. For
    backward compatibility reasons,`'IPv4'` and `'IPv6'` are interpreted as `4`
    and `6` respectively. The value `0` indicates that IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    are both returned. **Default:** `0`.
  * `hints` {number} One or more [supported `getaddrinfo` flags][]. Multiple
    flags may be passed by bitwise `OR`ing their values.
  * `all` {boolean} When `true`, the callback returns all resolved addresses in
    an array. Otherwise, returns a single address. **Default:** `false`.
  * `verbatim` {boolean} When `true`, the callback receives IPv4 and IPv6
    addresses in the order the DNS resolver returned them. When `false`,
    IPv4 addresses are placed before IPv6 addresses.
    **Default:** `true` (addresses are not reordered). Default value is
    configurable using [`dns.setDefaultResultOrder()`][] or
    [`--dns-result-order`][].
* `callback` {Function}
  * `err` {Error}
  * `address` {string} A string representation of an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
  * `family` {integer} `4` or `6`, denoting the family of `address`, or `0` if
    the address is not an IPv4 or IPv6 address. `0` is a likely indicator of a
    bug in the name resolution service used by the operating system.

Resolves a host name (e.g. `'nodejs.org'`) into the first found A (IPv4) or
AAAA (IPv6) record. All `option` properties are optional. If `options` is an
integer, then it must be `4` or `6` â€“ if `options` is `0` or not provided, then
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are both returned if found.

With the `all` option set to `true`, the arguments for `callback` change to
`(err, addresses)`, with `addresses` being an array of objects with the
properties `address` and `family`.

On error, `err` is an [`Error`][] object, where `err.code` is the error code.
Keep in mind that `err.code` will be set to `'ENOTFOUND'` not only when
the host name does not exist but also when the lookup fails in other ways
such as no available file descriptors.

`dns.lookup()` does not necessarily have anything to do with the DNS protocol.
The implementation uses an operating system facility that can associate names
with addresses and vice versa. This implementation can have subtle but
important consequences on the behavior of any Node.js program. Please take some
time to consult the [Implementation considerations section][] before using
`dns.lookup()`.

Example usage:

```js
const dns = require('node:dns');
const options = {
  family: 6,
  hints: dns.ADDRCONFIG | dns.V4MAPPED,
};
dns.lookup('example.com', options, (err, address, family) =>
  console.log('address: %j family: IPv%s', address, family));
// address: "2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946" family: IPv6

// When options.all is true, the result will be an Array.
options.all = true;
dns.lookup('example.com', options, (err, addresses) =>
  console.log('addresses: %j', addresses));
// addresses: [{"address":"2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946","family":6}]
```

If this method is invoked as its [`util.promisify()`][]ed version, and `all`
is not set to `true`, it returns a `Promise` for an `Object` with `address` and
`family` properties.
