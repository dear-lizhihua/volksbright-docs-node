## Class: `dns.Resolver`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.3.0
-->

An independent resolver for DNS requests.

Creating a new resolver uses the default server settings. Setting
the servers used for a resolver using
[`resolver.setServers()`][`dns.setServers()`] does not affect
other resolvers:

```js
const { Resolver } = require('node:dns');
const resolver = new Resolver();
resolver.setServers(['4.4.4.4']);

// This request will use the server at 4.4.4.4, independent of global settings.
resolver.resolve4('example.org', (err, addresses) => {
  // ...
});
```

The following methods from the `node:dns` module are available:

* [`resolver.getServers()`][`dns.getServers()`]
* [`resolver.resolve()`][`dns.resolve()`]
* [`resolver.resolve4()`][`dns.resolve4()`]
* [`resolver.resolve6()`][`dns.resolve6()`]
* [`resolver.resolveAny()`][`dns.resolveAny()`]
* [`resolver.resolveCaa()`][`dns.resolveCaa()`]
* [`resolver.resolveCname()`][`dns.resolveCname()`]
* [`resolver.resolveMx()`][`dns.resolveMx()`]
* [`resolver.resolveNaptr()`][`dns.resolveNaptr()`]
* [`resolver.resolveNs()`][`dns.resolveNs()`]
* [`resolver.resolvePtr()`][`dns.resolvePtr()`]
* [`resolver.resolveSoa()`][`dns.resolveSoa()`]
* [`resolver.resolveSrv()`][`dns.resolveSrv()`]
* [`resolver.resolveTxt()`][`dns.resolveTxt()`]
* [`resolver.reverse()`][`dns.reverse()`]
* [`resolver.setServers()`][`dns.setServers()`]
