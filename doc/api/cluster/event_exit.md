### Event: `'exit'`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.11.2
-->

* `code` {number} The exit code, if it exited normally.
* `signal` {string} The name of the signal (e.g. `'SIGHUP'`) that caused
  the process to be killed.

Similar to the `cluster.on('exit')` event, but specific to this worker.

```mjs
import cluster from 'node:cluster';

if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  const worker = cluster.fork();
  worker.on('exit', (code, signal) => {
    if (signal) {
      console.log(`worker was killed by signal: ${signal}`);
    } else if (code !== 0) {
      console.log(`worker exited with error code: ${code}`);
    } else {
      console.log('worker success!');
    }
  });
}
```

```cjs
const cluster = require('node:cluster');

if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  const worker = cluster.fork();
  worker.on('exit', (code, signal) => {
    if (signal) {
      console.log(`worker was killed by signal: ${signal}`);
    } else if (code !== 0) {
      console.log(`worker exited with error code: ${code}`);
    } else {
      console.log('worker success!');
    }
  });
}
```
