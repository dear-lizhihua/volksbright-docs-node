## Event: `'exit'`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.9
-->

* `worker` {cluster.Worker}
* `code` {number} The exit code, if it exited normally.
* `signal` {string} The name of the signal (e.g. `'SIGHUP'`) that caused
  the process to be killed.

When any of the workers die the cluster module will emit the `'exit'` event.

This can be used to restart the worker by calling [`.fork()`][] again.

```js
cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
  console.log('worker %d died (%s). restarting...',
              worker.process.pid, signal || code);
  cluster.fork();
});
```
