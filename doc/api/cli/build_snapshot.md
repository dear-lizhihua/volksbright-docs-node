### `--build-snapshot`

<!-- YAML
added: v18.8.0
-->

> Stability: 1 - Experimental

Generates a snapshot blob when the process exits and writes it to
disk, which can be loaded later with `--snapshot-blob`.

When building the snapshot, if `--snapshot-blob` is not specified,
the generated blob will be written, by default, to `snapshot.blob`
in the current working directory. Otherwise it will be written to
the path specified by `--snapshot-blob`.

```console
$ echo "globalThis.foo = 'I am from the snapshot'" > snapshot.js
