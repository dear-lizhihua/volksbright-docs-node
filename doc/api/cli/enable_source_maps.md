Enable [Source Map v3][Source Map] support for stack traces.

When using a transpiler, such as TypeScript, stack traces thrown by an
application reference the transpiled code, not the original source position.
`--enable-source-maps` enables caching of Source Maps and makes a best
effort to report stack traces relative to the original source file.

Overriding `Error.prepareStackTrace` prevents `--enable-source-maps` from
modifying the stack trace.

Note, enabling source maps can introduce latency to your application
when `Error.stack` is accessed. If you access `Error.stack` frequently
in your application, take into account the performance implications
of `--enable-source-maps`.
