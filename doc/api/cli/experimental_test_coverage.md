### `--experimental-test-coverage`

<!-- YAML
added: REPLACEME
-->

When used in conjunction with the `node:test` module, a code coverage report is
generated as part of the test runner output. If no tests are run, a coverage
report is not generated. See the documentation on
[collecting code coverage from tests][] for more details.
