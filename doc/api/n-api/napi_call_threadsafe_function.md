    description: Return `napi_would_deadlock` when called with
                 `napi_tsfn_blocking` from the main thread or a worker thread
                 and the queue is full.

```c
NAPI_EXTERN napi_status
napi_call_threadsafe_function(napi_threadsafe_function func,
                              void* data,
                              napi_threadsafe_function_call_mode is_blocking);
```

* `[in] func`: The asynchronous thread-safe JavaScript function to invoke.
* `[in] data`: Data to send into JavaScript via the callback `call_js_cb`
  provided during the creation of the thread-safe JavaScript function.
* `[in] is_blocking`: Flag whose value can be either `napi_tsfn_blocking` to
  indicate that the call should block if the queue is full or
  `napi_tsfn_nonblocking` to indicate that the call should return immediately
  with a status of `napi_queue_full` whenever the queue is full.

This API should not be called with `napi_tsfn_blocking` from a JavaScript
thread, because, if the queue is full, it may cause the JavaScript thread to
deadlock.

This API will return `napi_closing` if `napi_release_threadsafe_function()` was
called with `abort` set to `napi_tsfn_abort` from any thread. The value is only
added to the queue if the API returns `napi_ok`.

This API may be called from any thread which makes use of `func`.
