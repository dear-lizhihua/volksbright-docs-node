```c
napi_status napi_create_async_work(napi_env env,
                                   napi_value async_resource,
                                   napi_value async_resource_name,
                                   napi_async_execute_callback execute,
                                   napi_async_complete_callback complete,
                                   void* data,
                                   napi_async_work* result);
```

* `[in] env`: The environment that the API is invoked under.
* `[in] async_resource`: An optional object associated with the async work
  that will be passed to possible `async_hooks` [`init` hooks][].
* `[in] async_resource_name`: Identifier for the kind of resource that is being
  provided for diagnostic information exposed by the `async_hooks` API.
* `[in] execute`: The native function which should be called to execute the
  logic asynchronously. The given function is called from a worker pool thread
  and can execute in parallel with the main event loop thread.
* `[in] complete`: The native function which will be called when the
  asynchronous logic is completed or is cancelled. The given function is called
  from the main event loop thread. [`napi_async_complete_callback`][] provides
  more details.
* `[in] data`: User-provided data context. This will be passed back into the
  execute and complete functions.
* `[out] result`: `napi_async_work*` which is the handle to the newly created
  async work.

Returns `napi_ok` if the API succeeded.

This API allocates a work object that is used to execute logic asynchronously.
It should be freed using [`napi_delete_async_work`][] once the work is no longer
required.

`async_resource_name` should be a null-terminated, UTF-8-encoded string.

The `async_resource_name` identifier is provided by the user and should be
representative of the type of async work being performed. It is also recommended
to apply namespacing to the identifier, e.g. by including the module name. See
the [`async_hooks` documentation][async_hooks `type`] for more information.
