## Working with JavaScript values and abstract operations

Node-API exposes a set of APIs to perform some abstract operations on JavaScript
values. Some of these operations are documented under [Section 7][]
of the [ECMAScript Language Specification][].

These APIs support doing one of the following:

1. Coerce JavaScript values to specific JavaScript types (such as `number` or
   `string`).
2. Check the type of a JavaScript value.
3. Check for equality between two JavaScript values.
