```c
NAPI_EXTERN napi_status napi_open_callback_scope(napi_env env,
                                                 napi_value resource_object,
                                                 napi_async_context context,
                                                 napi_callback_scope* result)
```

* `[in] env`: The environment that the API is invoked under.
* `[in] resource_object`: An object associated with the async work
  that will be passed to possible `async_hooks` [`init` hooks][]. This
  parameter has been deprecated and is ignored at runtime. Use the
  `async_resource` parameter in [`napi_async_init`][] instead.
* `[in] context`: Context for the async operation that is invoking the callback.
  This should be a value previously obtained from [`napi_async_init`][].
* `[out] result`: The newly created scope.

There are cases (for example, resolving promises) where it is
necessary to have the equivalent of the scope associated with a callback
in place when making certain Node-API calls. If there is no other script on
the stack the [`napi_open_callback_scope`][] and
[`napi_close_callback_scope`][] functions can be used to open/close
the required scope.
