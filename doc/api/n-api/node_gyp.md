#### node-gyp

[node-gyp][] is a build system based on the [gyp-next][] fork of
Google's [GYP][] tool and comes bundled with npm. GYP, and therefore node-gyp,
requires that Python be installed.

Historically, node-gyp has been the tool of choice for building native
addons. It has widespread adoption and documentation. However, some
developers have run into limitations in node-gyp.
