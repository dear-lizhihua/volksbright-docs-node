## Usage

In order to use the Node-API functions, include the file [`node_api.h`][] which
is located in the src directory in the node development tree:

```c
#include <node_api.h>
```

This will opt into the default `NAPI_VERSION` for the given release of Node.js.
In order to ensure compatibility with specific versions of Node-API, the version
can be specified explicitly when including the header:

```c
#define NAPI_VERSION 3
#include <node_api.h>
```

This restricts the Node-API surface to just the functionality that was available
in the specified (and earlier) versions.

Some of the Node-API surface is experimental and requires explicit opt-in:

```c
#define NAPI_EXPERIMENTAL
#include <node_api.h>
```

In this case the entire API surface, including any experimental APIs, will be
available to the module code.
