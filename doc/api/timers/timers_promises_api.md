The `timers/promises` API provides an alternative set of timer functions
that return `Promise` objects. The API is accessible via
`require('node:timers/promises')`.

```mjs
import {
  setTimeout,
  setImmediate,
  setInterval,
} from 'timers/promises';
```

```cjs
const {
  setTimeout,
  setImmediate,
  setInterval,
} = require('node:timers/promises');
```
