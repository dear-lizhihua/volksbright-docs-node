### `immediate.unref()`

<!-- YAML
added: v9.7.0
-->

* Returns: {Immediate} a reference to `immediate`

When called, the active `Immediate` object will not require the Node.js event
loop to remain active. If there is no other activity keeping the event loop
running, the process may exit before the `Immediate` object's callback is
invoked. Calling `immediate.unref()` multiple times will have no effect.
