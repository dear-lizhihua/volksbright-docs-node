### Linking to libraries included with Node.js

Node.js uses statically linked libraries such as V8, libuv, and OpenSSL. All
addons are required to link to V8 and may link to any of the other dependencies
as well. Typically, this is as simple as including the appropriate
`#include <...>` statements (e.g. `#include <v8.h>`) and `node-gyp` will locate
the appropriate headers automatically. However, there are a few caveats to be
aware of:

* When `node-gyp` runs, it will detect the specific release version of Node.js
  and download either the full source tarball or just the headers. If the full
  source is downloaded, addons will have complete access to the full set of
  Node.js dependencies. However, if only the Node.js headers are downloaded,
  then only the symbols exported by Node.js will be available.

* `node-gyp` can be run using the `--nodedir` flag pointing at a local Node.js
  source image. Using this option, the addon will have access to the full set of
  dependencies.
