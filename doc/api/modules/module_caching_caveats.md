### Module caching caveats

<!--type=misc-->

Modules are cached based on their resolved filename. Since modules may resolve
to a different filename based on the location of the calling module (loading
from `node_modules` folders), it is not a _guarantee_ that `require('foo')` will
always return the exact same object, if it would resolve to different files.

Additionally, on case-insensitive file systems or operating systems, different
resolved filenames can point to the same file, but the cache will still treat
them as different modules and will reload the file multiple times. For example,
`require('./foo')` and `require('./FOO')` return two different objects,
irrespective of whether or not `./foo` and `./FOO` are the same file.
