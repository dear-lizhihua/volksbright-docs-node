## Package manager tips

<!-- type=misc -->

The semantics of the Node.js `require()` function were designed to be general
enough to support reasonable directory structures. Package manager programs
such as `dpkg`, `rpm`, and `npm` will hopefully find it possible to build
native packages from Node.js modules without modification.

Below we give a suggested directory structure that could work:

Let's say that we wanted to have the folder at
`/usr/lib/node/<some-package>/<some-version>` hold the contents of a
specific version of a package.

Packages can depend on one another. In order to install package `foo`, it
may be necessary to install a specific version of package `bar`. The `bar`
package may itself have dependencies, and in some cases, these may even collide
or form cyclic dependencies.

Because Node.js looks up the `realpath` of any modules it loads (that is, it
resolves symlinks) and then [looks for their dependencies in `node_modules` folders](#loading-from-node_modules-folders),
this situation can be resolved with the following architecture:

* `/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/`: Contents of the `foo` package, version 1.2.3.
* `/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/`: Contents of the `bar` package that `foo` depends
  on.
* `/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/node_modules/bar`: Symbolic link to
  `/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/`.
* `/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/node_modules/*`: Symbolic links to the packages that
  `bar` depends on.

Thus, even if a cycle is encountered, or if there are dependency
conflicts, every module will be able to get a version of its dependency
that it can use.

When the code in the `foo` package does `require('bar')`, it will get the
version that is symlinked into `/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/node_modules/bar`.
Then, when the code in the `bar` package calls `require('quux')`, it'll get
the version that is symlinked into
`/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/node_modules/quux`.

Furthermore, to make the module lookup process even more optimal, rather
than putting packages directly in `/usr/lib/node`, we could put them in
`/usr/lib/node_modules/<name>/<version>`. Then Node.js will not bother
looking for missing dependencies in `/usr/node_modules` or `/node_modules`.

In order to make modules available to the Node.js REPL, it might be useful to
also add the `/usr/lib/node_modules` folder to the `$NODE_PATH` environment
variable. Since the module lookups using `node_modules` folders are all
relative, and based on the real path of the files making the calls to
`require()`, the packages themselves can be anywhere.
