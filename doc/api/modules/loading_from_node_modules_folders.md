## Loading from `node_modules` folders

<!--type=misc-->

If the module identifier passed to `require()` is not a
[core](#core-modules) module, and does not begin with `'/'`, `'../'`, or
`'./'`, then Node.js starts at the directory of the current module, and
adds `/node_modules`, and attempts to load the module from that location.
Node.js will not append `node_modules` to a path already ending in
`node_modules`.

If it is not found there, then it moves to the parent directory, and so
on, until the root of the file system is reached.

For example, if the file at `'/home/ry/projects/foo.js'` called
`require('bar.js')`, then Node.js would look in the following locations, in
this order:

* `/home/ry/projects/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/home/ry/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/home/node_modules/bar.js`
* `/node_modules/bar.js`

This allows programs to localize their dependencies, so that they do not
clash.

It is possible to require specific files or sub modules distributed with a
module by including a path suffix after the module name. For instance
`require('example-module/path/to/file')` would resolve `path/to/file`
relative to where `example-module` is located. The suffixed path follows the
same module resolution semantics.
