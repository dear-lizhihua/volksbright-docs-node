### `module.exports`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.16

* {Object}

The `module.exports` object is created by the `Module` system. Sometimes this is
not acceptable; many want their module to be an instance of some class. To do
this, assign the desired export object to `module.exports`. Assigning
the desired object to `exports` will simply rebind the local `exports` variable,
which is probably not what is desired.

For example, suppose we were making a module called `a.js`:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('node:events');

module.exports = new EventEmitter();

// Do some work, and after some time emit
// the 'ready' event from the module itself.
setTimeout(() => {
  module.exports.emit('ready');
}, 1000);
```

Then in another file we could do:

```js
const a = require('./a');
a.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('module "a" is ready');
});
```

Assignment to `module.exports` must be done immediately. It cannot be
done in any callbacks. This does not work:

`x.js`:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  module.exports = { a: 'hello' };
}, 0);
```

`y.js`:

```js
const x = require('./x');
console.log(x.a);
```
