Instruct `require` on how to handle certain file extensions.

Process files with the extension `.sjs` as `.js`:

```js
require.extensions['.sjs'] = require.extensions['.js'];
```

**Deprecated.** In the past, this list has been used to load non-JavaScript
modules into Node.js by compiling them on-demand. However, in practice, there
are much better ways to do this, such as loading modules via some other Node.js
program, or compiling them to JavaScript ahead of time.

Avoid using `require.extensions`. Use could cause subtle bugs and resolving the
extensions gets slower with each registered extension.
