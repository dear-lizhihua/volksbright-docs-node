## Callback example

The callback form takes a completion callback function as its last
argument and invokes the operation asynchronously. The arguments passed to
the completion callback depend on the method, but the first argument is always
reserved for an exception. If the operation is completed successfully, then
the first argument is `null` or `undefined`.

```mjs
import { unlink } from 'node:fs';

unlink('/tmp/hello', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('successfully deleted /tmp/hello');
});
```

```cjs
const { unlink } = require('node:fs');

unlink('/tmp/hello', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('successfully deleted /tmp/hello');
});
```

The callback-based versions of the `node:fs` module APIs are preferable over
the use of the promise APIs when maximal performance (both in terms of
execution time and memory allocation) is required.
