-->

* `path` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `options` {string|Object}
  * `flags` {string} See [support of file system `flags`][]. **Default:**
    `'w'`.
  * `encoding` {string} **Default:** `'utf8'`
  * `fd` {integer|FileHandle} **Default:** `null`
  * `mode` {integer} **Default:** `0o666`
  * `autoClose` {boolean} **Default:** `true`
  * `emitClose` {boolean} **Default:** `true`
  * `start` {integer}
  * `fs` {Object|null} **Default:** `null`
* Returns: {fs.WriteStream}

`options` may also include a `start` option to allow writing data at some
position past the beginning of the file, allowed values are in the
\[0, [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`][]] range. Modifying a file rather than
replacing it may require the `flags` option to be set to `r+` rather than the
default `w`. The `encoding` can be any one of those accepted by {Buffer}.

If `autoClose` is set to true (default behavior) on `'error'` or `'finish'`
the file descriptor will be closed automatically. If `autoClose` is false,
then the file descriptor won't be closed, even if there's an error.
It is the application's responsibility to close it and make sure there's no
file descriptor leak.

By default, the stream will emit a `'close'` event after it has been
destroyed.  Set the `emitClose` option to `false` to change this behavior.

By providing the `fs` option it is possible to override the corresponding `fs`
implementations for `open`, `write`, `writev`, and `close`. Overriding `write()`
without `writev()` can reduce performance as some optimizations (`_writev()`)
will be disabled. When providing the `fs` option, overrides for at least one of
`write` and `writev` are required. If no `fd` option is supplied, an override
for `open` is also required. If `autoClose` is `true`, an override for `close`
is also required.

Like {fs.ReadStream}, if `fd` is specified, {fs.WriteStream} will ignore the
`path` argument and will use the specified file descriptor. This means that no
`'open'` event will be emitted. `fd` should be blocking; non-blocking `fd`s
should be passed to {net.Socket}.

If `options` is a string, then it specifies the encoding.
