##### File open constants

The following constants are meant for use with `fs.open()`.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Constant</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_RDONLY</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating to open a file for read-only access.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_WRONLY</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating to open a file for write-only access.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_RDWR</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating to open a file for read-write access.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_CREAT</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating to create the file if it does not already exist.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_EXCL</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that opening a file should fail if the
    <code>O_CREAT</code> flag is set and the file already exists.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_NOCTTY</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that if path identifies a terminal device, opening the
    path shall not cause that terminal to become the controlling terminal for
    the process (if the process does not already have one).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_TRUNC</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that if the file exists and is a regular file, and the
    file is opened successfully for write access, its length shall be truncated
    to zero.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_APPEND</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that data will be appended to the end of the file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_DIRECTORY</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that the open should fail if the path is not a
    directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><code>O_NOATIME</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating reading accesses to the file system will no longer
    result in an update to the <code>atime</code> information associated with
    the file. This flag is available on Linux operating systems only.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_NOFOLLOW</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that the open should fail if the path is a symbolic
    link.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_SYNC</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that the file is opened for synchronized I/O with write
    operations waiting for file integrity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_DSYNC</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that the file is opened for synchronized I/O with write
    operations waiting for data integrity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_SYMLINK</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating to open the symbolic link itself rather than the
    resource it is pointing to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_DIRECT</code></td>
    <td>When set, an attempt will be made to minimize caching effects of file
    I/O.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>O_NONBLOCK</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating to open the file in nonblocking mode when possible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>UV_FS_O_FILEMAP</code></td>
    <td>When set, a memory file mapping is used to access the file. This flag
    is available on Windows operating systems only. On other operating systems,
    this flag is ignored.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

On Windows, only `O_APPEND`, `O_CREAT`, `O_EXCL`, `O_RDONLY`, `O_RDWR`,
`O_TRUNC`, `O_WRONLY`, and `UV_FS_O_FILEMAP` are available.
