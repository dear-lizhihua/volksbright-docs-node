* `path` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `flags` {string|number} See [support of file system `flags`][].
  **Default:** `'r'`.
* `mode` {string|integer} Sets the file mode (permission and sticky bits)
  if the file is created. **Default:** `0o666` (readable and writable)

Some characters (`< > : " / \ | ? *`) are reserved under Windows as documented
by [Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces][]. Under NTFS, if the filename contains
a colon, Node.js will open a file system stream, as described by
[this MSDN page][MSDN-Using-Streams].
