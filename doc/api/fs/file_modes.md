#### File modes

The `mode` argument used in both the `fs.chmod()` and `fs.chmodSync()`
methods is a numeric bitmask created using a logical OR of the following
constants:

| Constant               | Octal   | Description              |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| `fs.constants.S_IRUSR` | `0o400` | read by owner            |
| `fs.constants.S_IWUSR` | `0o200` | write by owner           |
| `fs.constants.S_IXUSR` | `0o100` | execute/search by owner  |
| `fs.constants.S_IRGRP` | `0o40`  | read by group            |
| `fs.constants.S_IWGRP` | `0o20`  | write by group           |
| `fs.constants.S_IXGRP` | `0o10`  | execute/search by group  |
| `fs.constants.S_IROTH` | `0o4`   | read by others           |
| `fs.constants.S_IWOTH` | `0o2`   | write by others          |
| `fs.constants.S_IXOTH` | `0o1`   | execute/search by others |

An easier method of constructing the `mode` is to use a sequence of three
octal digits (e.g. `765`). The left-most digit (`7` in the example), specifies
the permissions for the file owner. The middle digit (`6` in the example),
specifies permissions for the group. The right-most digit (`5` in the example),
specifies the permissions for others.

| Number | Description              |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| `7`    | read, write, and execute |
| `6`    | read and write           |
| `5`    | read and execute         |
| `4`    | read only                |
| `3`    | write and execute        |
| `2`    | write only               |
| `1`    | execute only             |
| `0`    | no permission            |

For example, the octal value `0o765` means:

* The owner may read, write, and execute the file.
* The group may read and write the file.
* Others may read and execute the file.

When using raw numbers where file modes are expected, any value larger than
`0o777` may result in platform-specific behaviors that are not supported to work
consistently. Therefore constants like `S_ISVTX`, `S_ISGID`, or `S_ISUID` are
not exposed in `fs.constants`.

Caveats: on Windows only the write permission can be changed, and the
distinction among the permissions of group, owner, or others is not
implemented.
