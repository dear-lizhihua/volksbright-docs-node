#### `filehandle.createWriteStream([options])`

<!-- YAML
added: v16.11.0
-->

* `options` {Object}
  * `encoding` {string} **Default:** `'utf8'`
  * `autoClose` {boolean} **Default:** `true`
  * `emitClose` {boolean} **Default:** `true`
  * `start` {integer}
* Returns: {fs.WriteStream}

`options` may also include a `start` option to allow writing data at some
position past the beginning of the file, allowed values are in the
\[0, [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`][]] range. Modifying a file rather than
replacing it may require the `flags` `open` option to be set to `r+` rather than
the default `r`. The `encoding` can be any one of those accepted by {Buffer}.

If `autoClose` is set to true (default behavior) on `'error'` or `'finish'`
the file descriptor will be closed automatically. If `autoClose` is false,
then the file descriptor won't be closed, even if there's an error.
It is the application's responsibility to close it and make sure there's no
file descriptor leak.

By default, the stream will emit a `'close'` event after it has been
destroyed.  Set the `emitClose` option to `false` to change this behavior.
