#### FS constants

The following constants are exported by `fs.constants` and `fsPromises.constants`.

Not every constant will be available on every operating system;
this is especially important for Windows, where many of the POSIX specific
definitions are not available.
For portable applications it is recommended to check for their presence
before use.

To use more than one constant, use the bitwise OR `|` operator.

Example:

```mjs
import { open, constants } from 'node:fs';

const {
  O_RDWR,
  O_CREAT,
  O_EXCL,
} = constants;

open('/path/to/my/file', O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_EXCL, (err, fd) => {
  // ...
});
```
