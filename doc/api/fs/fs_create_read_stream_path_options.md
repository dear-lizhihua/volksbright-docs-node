* `path` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `options` {string|Object}
  * `flags` {string} See [support of file system `flags`][]. **Default:**
    `'r'`.
  * `encoding` {string} **Default:** `null`
  * `fd` {integer|FileHandle} **Default:** `null`
  * `mode` {integer} **Default:** `0o666`
  * `autoClose` {boolean} **Default:** `true`
  * `emitClose` {boolean} **Default:** `true`
  * `start` {integer}
  * `end` {integer} **Default:** `Infinity`
  * `highWaterMark` {integer} **Default:** `64 * 1024`
  * `fs` {Object|null} **Default:** `null`
* Returns: {fs.ReadStream}

Unlike the 16 KiB default `highWaterMark` for a {stream.Readable}, the stream
returned by this method has a default `highWaterMark` of 64 KiB.

`options` can include `start` and `end` values to read a range of bytes from
the file instead of the entire file. Both `start` and `end` are inclusive and
start counting at 0, allowed values are in the
\[0, [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`][]] range. If `fd` is specified and `start` is
omitted or `undefined`, `fs.createReadStream()` reads sequentially from the
current file position. The `encoding` can be any one of those accepted by
{Buffer}.

If `fd` is specified, `ReadStream` will ignore the `path` argument and will use
the specified file descriptor. This means that no `'open'` event will be
emitted. `fd` should be blocking; non-blocking `fd`s should be passed to
{net.Socket}.

If `fd` points to a character device that only supports blocking reads
(such as keyboard or sound card), read operations do not finish until data is
available. This can prevent the process from exiting and the stream from
closing naturally.

By default, the stream will emit a `'close'` event after it has been
destroyed.  Set the `emitClose` option to `false` to change this behavior.

By providing the `fs` option, it is possible to override the corresponding `fs`
implementations for `open`, `read`, and `close`. When providing the `fs` option,
an override for `read` is required. If no `fd` is provided, an override for
`open` is also required. If `autoClose` is `true`, an override for `close` is
also required.

```mjs
import { createReadStream } from 'node:fs';

// Create a stream from some character device.
const stream = createReadStream('/dev/input/event0');
setTimeout(() => {
  stream.close(); // This may not close the stream.
  // Artificially marking end-of-stream, as if the underlying resource had
  // indicated end-of-file by itself, allows the stream to close.
  // This does not cancel pending read operations, and if there is such an
  // operation, the process may still not be able to exit successfully
  // until it finishes.
  stream.push(null);
  stream.read(0);
}, 100);
```

If `autoClose` is false, then the file descriptor won't be closed, even if
there's an error. It is the application's responsibility to close it and make
sure there's no file descriptor leak. If `autoClose` is set to true (default
behavior), on `'error'` or `'end'` the file descriptor will be closed
automatically.

`mode` sets the file mode (permission and sticky bits), but only if the
file was created.

An example to read the last 10 bytes of a file which is 100 bytes long:

```mjs
import { createReadStream } from 'node:fs';

createReadStream('sample.txt', { start: 90, end: 99 });
```

If `options` is a string, then it specifies the encoding.
