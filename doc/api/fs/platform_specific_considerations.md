##### Platform-specific considerations

On Windows, `file:` {URL}s with a host name convert to UNC paths, while `file:`
{URL}s with drive letters convert to local absolute paths. `file:` {URL}s
with no host name and no drive letter will result in an error:

```mjs
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
// On Windows :

// - WHATWG file URLs with hostname convert to UNC path
// file://hostname/p/a/t/h/file => \\hostname\p\a\t\h\file
readFileSync(new URL('file://hostname/p/a/t/h/file'));

// - WHATWG file URLs with drive letters convert to absolute path
// file:///C:/tmp/hello => C:\tmp\hello
readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/tmp/hello'));

// - WHATWG file URLs without hostname must have a drive letters
readFileSync(new URL('file:///notdriveletter/p/a/t/h/file'));
readFileSync(new URL('file:///c/p/a/t/h/file'));
// TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must be absolute
```

`file:` {URL}s with drive letters must use `:` as a separator just after
the drive letter. Using another separator will result in an error.

On all other platforms, `file:` {URL}s with a host name are unsupported and
will result in an error:

```mjs
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
// On other platforms:

// - WHATWG file URLs with hostname are unsupported
// file://hostname/p/a/t/h/file => throw!
readFileSync(new URL('file://hostname/p/a/t/h/file'));
// TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: must be absolute

// - WHATWG file URLs convert to absolute path
// file:///tmp/hello => /tmp/hello
readFileSync(new URL('file:///tmp/hello'));
```

A `file:` {URL} having encoded slash characters will result in an error on all
platforms:

```mjs
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

// On Windows
readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/p/a/t/h/%2F'));
readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/p/a/t/h/%2f'));
/* TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must not include encoded
\ or / characters */

// On POSIX
readFileSync(new URL('file:///p/a/t/h/%2F'));
readFileSync(new URL('file:///p/a/t/h/%2f'));
/* TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must not include encoded
/ characters */
```

On Windows, `file:` {URL}s having encoded backslash will result in an error:

```mjs
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

// On Windows
readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/path/%5C'));
readFileSync(new URL('file:///C:/path/%5c'));
/* TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must not include encoded
\ or / characters */
```
