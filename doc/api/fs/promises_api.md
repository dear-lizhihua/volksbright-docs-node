The `fs/promises` API provides asynchronous file system methods that return
promises.

The promise APIs use the underlying Node.js threadpool to perform file
system operations off the event loop thread. These operations are not
synchronized or threadsafe. Care must be taken when performing multiple
concurrent modifications on the same file or data corruption may occur.
