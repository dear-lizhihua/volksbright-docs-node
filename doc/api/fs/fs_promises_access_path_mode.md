### `fsPromises.access(path[, mode])`

<!-- YAML
added: v10.0.0
-->

* `path` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `mode` {integer} **Default:** `fs.constants.F_OK`
* Returns: {Promise} Fulfills with `undefined` upon success.

Tests a user's permissions for the file or directory specified by `path`.
The `mode` argument is an optional integer that specifies the accessibility
checks to be performed. `mode` should be either the value `fs.constants.F_OK`
or a mask consisting of the bitwise OR of any of `fs.constants.R_OK`,
`fs.constants.W_OK`, and `fs.constants.X_OK` (e.g.
`fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.R_OK`). Check [File access constants][] for
possible values of `mode`.

If the accessibility check is successful, the promise is resolved with no
value. If any of the accessibility checks fail, the promise is rejected
with an {Error} object. The following example checks if the file
`/etc/passwd` can be read and written by the current process.

```mjs
import { access, constants } from 'node:fs/promises';

try {
  await access('/etc/passwd', constants.R_OK | constants.W_OK);
  console.log('can access');
} catch {
  console.error('cannot access');
}
```

Using `fsPromises.access()` to check for the accessibility of a file before
calling `fsPromises.open()` is not recommended. Doing so introduces a race
condition, since other processes may change the file's state between the two
calls. Instead, user code should open/read/write the file directly and handle
the error raised if the file is not accessible.
