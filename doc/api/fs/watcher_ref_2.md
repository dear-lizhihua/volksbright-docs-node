#### `watcher.ref()`

* Returns: {fs.StatWatcher}

When called, requests that the Node.js event loop _not_ exit so long as the
{fs.StatWatcher} is active. Calling `watcher.ref()` multiple times will have
no effect.

By default, all {fs.StatWatcher} objects are "ref'ed", making it normally
unnecessary to call `watcher.ref()` unless `watcher.unref()` had been
called previously.
