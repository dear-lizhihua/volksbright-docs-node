### `fs.copyFileSync(src, dest[, mode])`

    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27044
    description: Changed `flags` argument to `mode` and imposed
                 stricter type validation.

* `src` {string|Buffer|URL} source filename to copy
* `dest` {string|Buffer|URL} destination filename of the copy operation
* `mode` {integer} modifiers for copy operation. **Default:** `0`.

Synchronously copies `src` to `dest`. By default, `dest` is overwritten if it
already exists. Returns `undefined`. Node.js makes no guarantees about the
atomicity of the copy operation. If an error occurs after the destination file
has been opened for writing, Node.js will attempt to remove the destination.

`mode` is an optional integer that specifies the behavior
of the copy operation. It is possible to create a mask consisting of the bitwise
OR of two or more values (e.g.
`fs.constants.COPYFILE_EXCL | fs.constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE`).

* `fs.constants.COPYFILE_EXCL`: The copy operation will fail if `dest` already
  exists.
* `fs.constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE`: The copy operation will attempt to create a
  copy-on-write reflink. If the platform does not support copy-on-write, then a
  fallback copy mechanism is used.
* `fs.constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE_FORCE`: The copy operation will attempt to
  create a copy-on-write reflink. If the platform does not support
  copy-on-write, then the operation will fail.

```mjs
import { copyFileSync, constants } from 'node:fs';

// destination.txt will be created or overwritten by default.
copyFileSync('source.txt', 'destination.txt');
console.log('source.txt was copied to destination.txt');

// By using COPYFILE_EXCL, the operation will fail if destination.txt exists.
copyFileSync('source.txt', 'destination.txt', constants.COPYFILE_EXCL);
```
