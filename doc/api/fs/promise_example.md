## Promise example

Promise-based operations return a promise that is fulfilled when the
asynchronous operation is complete.

```mjs
import { unlink } from 'node:fs/promises';

try {
  await unlink('/tmp/hello');
  console.log('successfully deleted /tmp/hello');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('there was an error:', error.message);
}
```

```cjs
const { unlink } = require('node:fs/promises');

(async function(path) {
  try {
    await unlink(path);
    console.log(`successfully deleted ${path}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('there was an error:', error.message);
  }
})('/tmp/hello');
```
