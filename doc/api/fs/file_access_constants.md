##### File access constants

The following constants are meant for use as the `mode` parameter passed to
[`fsPromises.access()`][], [`fs.access()`][], and [`fs.accessSync()`][].

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Constant</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>F_OK</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that the file is visible to the calling process.
     This is useful for determining if a file exists, but says nothing
     about <code>rwx</code> permissions. Default if no mode is specified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>R_OK</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that the file can be read by the calling process.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>W_OK</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that the file can be written by the calling
    process.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>X_OK</code></td>
    <td>Flag indicating that the file can be executed by the calling
    process. This has no effect on Windows
    (will behave like <code>fs.constants.F_OK</code>).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The definitions are also available on Windows.
