### File descriptors

On POSIX systems, for every process, the kernel maintains a table of currently
open files and resources. Each open file is assigned a simple numeric
identifier called a _file descriptor_. At the system-level, all file system
operations use these file descriptors to identify and track each specific
file. Windows systems use a different but conceptually similar mechanism for
tracking resources. To simplify things for users, Node.js abstracts away the
differences between operating systems and assigns all open files a numeric file
descriptor.

The callback-based `fs.open()`, and synchronous `fs.openSync()` methods open a
file and allocate a new file descriptor. Once allocated, the file descriptor may
be used to read data from, write data to, or request information about the file.

Operating systems limit the number of file descriptors that may be open
at any given time so it is critical to close the descriptor when operations
are completed. Failure to do so will result in a memory leak that will
eventually cause an application to crash.

```mjs
import { open, close, fstat } from 'node:fs';

function closeFd(fd) {
  close(fd, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
}

open('/open/some/file.txt', 'r', (err, fd) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  try {
    fstat(fd, (err, stat) => {
      if (err) {
        closeFd(fd);
        throw err;
      }

      // use stat

      closeFd(fd);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    closeFd(fd);
    throw err;
  }
});
```

The promise-based APIs use a {FileHandle} object in place of the numeric
file descriptor. These objects are better managed by the system to ensure
that resources are not leaked. However, it is still required that they are
closed when operations are completed:

```mjs
import { open } from 'node:fs/promises';

let file;
try {
  file = await open('/open/some/file.txt', 'r');
  const stat = await file.stat();
  // use stat
} finally {
  await file.close();
}
```
