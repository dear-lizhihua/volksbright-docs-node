#### `filehandle.truncate(len)`

<!-- YAML
added: v10.0.0
-->

* `len` {integer} **Default:** `0`
* Returns: {Promise} Fulfills with `undefined` upon success.

Truncates the file.

If the file was larger than `len` bytes, only the first `len` bytes will be
retained in the file.

The following example retains only the first four bytes of the file:

```mjs
import { open } from 'node:fs/promises';

let filehandle = null;
try {
  filehandle = await open('temp.txt', 'r+');
  await filehandle.truncate(4);
} finally {
  await filehandle?.close();
}
```

If the file previously was shorter than `len` bytes, it is extended, and the
extended part is filled with null bytes (`'\0'`):

If `len` is negative then `0` will be used.
