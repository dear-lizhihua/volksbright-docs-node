#### Warning: Using `'uncaughtException'` correctly

`'uncaughtException'` is a crude mechanism for exception handling
intended to be used only as a last resort. The event _should not_ be used as
an equivalent to `On Error Resume Next`. Unhandled exceptions inherently mean
that an application is in an undefined state. Attempting to resume application
code without properly recovering from the exception can cause additional
unforeseen and unpredictable issues.

Exceptions thrown from within the event handler will not be caught. Instead the
process will exit with a non-zero exit code and the stack trace will be printed.
This is to avoid infinite recursion.

Attempting to resume normally after an uncaught exception can be similar to
pulling out the power cord when upgrading a computer. Nine out of ten
times, nothing happens. But the tenth time, the system becomes corrupted.

The correct use of `'uncaughtException'` is to perform synchronous cleanup
of allocated resources (e.g. file descriptors, handles, etc) before shutting
down the process. **It is not safe to resume normal operation after
`'uncaughtException'`.**

To restart a crashed application in a more reliable way, whether
`'uncaughtException'` is emitted or not, an external monitor should be employed
in a separate process to detect application failures and recover or restart as
needed.
