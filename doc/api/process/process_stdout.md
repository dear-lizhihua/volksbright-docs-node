## `process.stdout`

* {Stream}

The `process.stdout` property returns a stream connected to
`stdout` (fd `1`). It is a [`net.Socket`][] (which is a [Duplex][]
stream) unless fd `1` refers to a file, in which case it is
a [Writable][] stream.

For example, to copy `process.stdin` to `process.stdout`:

```mjs
import { stdin, stdout } from 'node:process';

stdin.pipe(stdout);
```

```cjs
const { stdin, stdout } = require('node:process');

stdin.pipe(stdout);
```

`process.stdout` differs from other Node.js streams in important ways. See
[note on process I/O][] for more information.
