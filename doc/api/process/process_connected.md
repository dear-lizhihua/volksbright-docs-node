## `process.connected`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.2
-->

* {boolean}

If the Node.js process is spawned with an IPC channel (see the [Child Process][]
and [Cluster][] documentation), the `process.connected` property will return
`true` so long as the IPC channel is connected and will return `false` after
`process.disconnect()` is called.

Once `process.connected` is `false`, it is no longer possible to send messages
over the IPC channel using `process.send()`.
