## `process.kill(pid[, signal])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.0.6
-->

* `pid` {number} A process ID
* `signal` {string|number} The signal to send, either as a string or number.
  **Default:** `'SIGTERM'`.

The `process.kill()` method sends the `signal` to the process identified by
`pid`.

Signal names are strings such as `'SIGINT'` or `'SIGHUP'`. See [Signal Events][]
and kill(2) for more information.

This method will throw an error if the target `pid` does not exist. As a special
case, a signal of `0` can be used to test for the existence of a process.
Windows platforms will throw an error if the `pid` is used to kill a process
group.

Even though the name of this function is `process.kill()`, it is really just a
signal sender, like the `kill` system call. The signal sent may do something
other than kill the target process.

```mjs
import process, { kill } from 'node:process';

process.on('SIGHUP', () => {
  console.log('Got SIGHUP signal.');
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Exiting.');
  process.exit(0);
}, 100);

kill(process.pid, 'SIGHUP');
```

```cjs
const process = require('node:process');

process.on('SIGHUP', () => {
  console.log('Got SIGHUP signal.');
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Exiting.');
  process.exit(0);
}, 100);

process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGHUP');
```

When `SIGUSR1` is received by a Node.js process, Node.js will start the
debugger. See [Signal Events][].
