## `process.hrtime([time])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.6
-->

> Stability: 3 - Legacy. Use [`process.hrtime.bigint()`][] instead.

* `time` {integer\[]} The result of a previous call to `process.hrtime()`
* Returns: {integer\[]}

This is the legacy version of [`process.hrtime.bigint()`][]
before `bigint` was introduced in JavaScript.

The `process.hrtime()` method returns the current high-resolution real time
in a `[seconds, nanoseconds]` tuple `Array`, where `nanoseconds` is the
remaining part of the real time that can't be represented in second precision.

`time` is an optional parameter that must be the result of a previous
`process.hrtime()` call to diff with the current time. If the parameter
passed in is not a tuple `Array`, a `TypeError` will be thrown. Passing in a
user-defined array instead of the result of a previous call to
`process.hrtime()` will lead to undefined behavior.

These times are relative to an arbitrary time in the
past, and not related to the time of day and therefore not subject to clock
drift. The primary use is for measuring performance between intervals:

```mjs
import { hrtime } from 'node:process';

const NS_PER_SEC = 1e9;
const time = hrtime();
// [ 1800216, 25 ]

setTimeout(() => {
  const diff = hrtime(time);
  // [ 1, 552 ]

  console.log(`Benchmark took ${diff[0] * NS_PER_SEC + diff[1]} nanoseconds`);
  // Benchmark took 1000000552 nanoseconds
}, 1000);
```

```cjs
const { hrtime } = require('node:process');

const NS_PER_SEC = 1e9;
const time = hrtime();
// [ 1800216, 25 ]

setTimeout(() => {
  const diff = hrtime(time);
  // [ 1, 552 ]

  console.log(`Benchmark took ${diff[0] * NS_PER_SEC + diff[1]} nanoseconds`);
  // Benchmark took 1000000552 nanoseconds
}, 1000);
```
