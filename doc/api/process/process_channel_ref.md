### `process.channel.ref()`

<!-- YAML
added: v7.1.0
-->

This method makes the IPC channel keep the event loop of the process
running if `.unref()` has been called before.

Typically, this is managed through the number of `'disconnect'` and `'message'`
listeners on the `process` object. However, this method can be used to
explicitly request a specific behavior.
