### `subprocess.stdout`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.90
-->

* {stream.Readable|null|undefined}

A `Readable Stream` that represents the child process's `stdout`.

If the child was spawned with `stdio[1]` set to anything other than `'pipe'`,
then this will be `null`.

`subprocess.stdout` is an alias for `subprocess.stdio[1]`. Both properties will
refer to the same value.

```js
const { spawn } = require('node:child_process');

const subprocess = spawn('ls');

subprocess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`Received chunk ${data}`);
});
```

The `subprocess.stdout` property can be `null` or `undefined`
if the child process could not be successfully spawned.
