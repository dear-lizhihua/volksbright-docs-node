-->

* `command` {string} The command to run.
* `args` {string\[]} List of string arguments.
* `options` {Object}
  * `cwd` {string|URL} Current working directory of the child process.
  * `input` {string|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView} The value which will be passed
    as stdin to the spawned process. Supplying this value will override
    `stdio[0]`.
  * `argv0` {string} Explicitly set the value of `argv[0]` sent to the child
    process. This will be set to `command` if not specified.
  * `stdio` {string|Array} Child's stdio configuration.
  * `env` {Object} Environment key-value pairs. **Default:** `process.env`.
  * `uid` {number} Sets the user identity of the process (see setuid(2)).
  * `gid` {number} Sets the group identity of the process (see setgid(2)).
  * `timeout` {number} In milliseconds the maximum amount of time the process
    is allowed to run. **Default:** `undefined`.
  * `killSignal` {string|integer} The signal value to be used when the spawned
    process will be killed. **Default:** `'SIGTERM'`.
  * `maxBuffer` {number} Largest amount of data in bytes allowed on stdout or
    stderr. If exceeded, the child process is terminated and any output is
    truncated. See caveat at [`maxBuffer` and Unicode][].
    **Default:** `1024 * 1024`.
  * `encoding` {string} The encoding used for all stdio inputs and outputs.
    **Default:** `'buffer'`.
  * `shell` {boolean|string} If `true`, runs `command` inside of a shell. Uses
    `'/bin/sh'` on Unix, and `process.env.ComSpec` on Windows. A different
    shell can be specified as a string. See [Shell requirements][] and
    [Default Windows shell][]. **Default:** `false` (no shell).
  * `windowsVerbatimArguments` {boolean} No quoting or escaping of arguments is
    done on Windows. Ignored on Unix. This is set to `true` automatically
    when `shell` is specified and is CMD. **Default:** `false`.
  * `windowsHide` {boolean} Hide the subprocess console window that would
    normally be created on Windows systems. **Default:** `false`.
* Returns: {Object}
  * `pid` {number} Pid of the child process.
  * `output` {Array} Array of results from stdio output.
  * `stdout` {Buffer|string} The contents of `output[1]`.
  * `stderr` {Buffer|string} The contents of `output[2]`.
  * `status` {number|null} The exit code of the subprocess, or `null` if the
    subprocess terminated due to a signal.
  * `signal` {string|null} The signal used to kill the subprocess, or `null` if
    the subprocess did not terminate due to a signal.
  * `error` {Error} The error object if the child process failed or timed out.

The `child_process.spawnSync()` method is generally identical to
[`child_process.spawn()`][] with the exception that the function will not return
until the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been encountered
and `killSignal` is sent, the method won't return until the process has
completely exited. If the process intercepts and handles the `SIGTERM` signal
and doesn't exit, the parent process will wait until the child process has
exited.

**If the `shell` option is enabled, do not pass unsanitized user input to this
function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger
arbitrary command execution.**
