### Event: `'exit'`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.90
-->

* `code` {number} The exit code if the child exited on its own.
* `signal` {string} The signal by which the child process was terminated.

The `'exit'` event is emitted after the child process ends. If the process
exited, `code` is the final exit code of the process, otherwise `null`. If the
process terminated due to receipt of a signal, `signal` is the string name of
the signal, otherwise `null`. One of the two will always be non-`null`.

When the `'exit'` event is triggered, child process stdio streams might still be
open.

Node.js establishes signal handlers for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` and Node.js
processes will not terminate immediately due to receipt of those signals.
Rather, Node.js will perform a sequence of cleanup actions and then will
re-raise the handled signal.
