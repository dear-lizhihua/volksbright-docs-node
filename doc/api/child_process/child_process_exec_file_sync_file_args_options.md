-->

* `file` {string} The name or path of the executable file to run.
* `args` {string\[]} List of string arguments.
* `options` {Object}
  * `cwd` {string|URL} Current working directory of the child process.
  * `input` {string|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView} The value which will be passed
    as stdin to the spawned process. Supplying this value will override
    `stdio[0]`.
  * `stdio` {string|Array} Child's stdio configuration. `stderr` by default will
    be output to the parent process' stderr unless `stdio` is specified.
    **Default:** `'pipe'`.
  * `env` {Object} Environment key-value pairs. **Default:** `process.env`.
  * `uid` {number} Sets the user identity of the process (see setuid(2)).
  * `gid` {number} Sets the group identity of the process (see setgid(2)).
  * `timeout` {number} In milliseconds the maximum amount of time the process
    is allowed to run. **Default:** `undefined`.
  * `killSignal` {string|integer} The signal value to be used when the spawned
    process will be killed. **Default:** `'SIGTERM'`.
  * `maxBuffer` {number} Largest amount of data in bytes allowed on stdout or
    stderr. If exceeded, the child process is terminated. See caveat at
    [`maxBuffer` and Unicode][]. **Default:** `1024 * 1024`.
  * `encoding` {string} The encoding used for all stdio inputs and outputs.
    **Default:** `'buffer'`.
  * `windowsHide` {boolean} Hide the subprocess console window that would
    normally be created on Windows systems. **Default:** `false`.
  * `shell` {boolean|string} If `true`, runs `command` inside of a shell. Uses
    `'/bin/sh'` on Unix, and `process.env.ComSpec` on Windows. A different
    shell can be specified as a string. See [Shell requirements][] and
    [Default Windows shell][]. **Default:** `false` (no shell).
* Returns: {Buffer|string} The stdout from the command.

The `child_process.execFileSync()` method is generally identical to
[`child_process.execFile()`][] with the exception that the method will not
return until the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been
encountered and `killSignal` is sent, the method won't return until the process
has completely exited.

If the child process intercepts and handles the `SIGTERM` signal and
does not exit, the parent process will still wait until the child process has
exited.

If the process times out or has a non-zero exit code, this method will throw an
[`Error`][] that will include the full result of the underlying
[`child_process.spawnSync()`][].

**If the `shell` option is enabled, do not pass unsanitized user input to this
function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger
arbitrary command execution.**
