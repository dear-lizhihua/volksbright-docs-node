* `message` {Object}
* `sendHandle` {Handle}
* `options` {Object} The `options` argument, if present, is an object used to
  parameterize the sending of certain types of handles. `options` supports
  the following properties:
  * `keepOpen` {boolean} A value that can be used when passing instances of
    `net.Socket`. When `true`, the socket is kept open in the sending process.
    **Default:** `false`.
* `callback` {Function}
* Returns: {boolean}

When an IPC channel has been established between the parent and child (
i.e. when using [`child_process.fork()`][]), the `subprocess.send()` method can
be used to send messages to the child process. When the child process is a
Node.js instance, these messages can be received via the [`'message'`][] event.

The message goes through serialization and parsing. The resulting
message might not be the same as what is originally sent.

For example, in the parent script:

```js
const cp = require('node:child_process');
const n = cp.fork(`${__dirname}/sub.js`);

n.on('message', (m) => {
  console.log('PARENT got message:', m);
});

// Causes the child to print: CHILD got message: { hello: 'world' }
n.send({ hello: 'world' });
```

And then the child script, `'sub.js'` might look like this:

```js
process.on('message', (m) => {
  console.log('CHILD got message:', m);
});

// Causes the parent to print: PARENT got message: { foo: 'bar', baz: null }
process.send({ foo: 'bar', baz: NaN });
```

Child Node.js processes will have a [`process.send()`][] method of their own
that allows the child to send messages back to the parent.

There is a special case when sending a `{cmd: 'NODE_foo'}` message. Messages
containing a `NODE_` prefix in the `cmd` property are reserved for use within
Node.js core and will not be emitted in the child's [`'message'`][]
event. Rather, such messages are emitted using the
`'internalMessage'` event and are consumed internally by Node.js.
Applications should avoid using such messages or listening for
`'internalMessage'` events as it is subject to change without notice.

The optional `sendHandle` argument that may be passed to `subprocess.send()` is
for passing a TCP server or socket object to the child process. The child will
receive the object as the second argument passed to the callback function
registered on the [`'message'`][] event. Any data that is received
and buffered in the socket will not be sent to the child.

The optional `callback` is a function that is invoked after the message is
sent but before the child may have received it. The function is called with a
single argument: `null` on success, or an [`Error`][] object on failure.

If no `callback` function is provided and the message cannot be sent, an
`'error'` event will be emitted by the [`ChildProcess`][] object. This can
happen, for instance, when the child process has already exited.

`subprocess.send()` will return `false` if the channel has closed or when the
backlog of unsent messages exceeds a threshold that makes it unwise to send
more. Otherwise, the method returns `true`. The `callback` function can be
used to implement flow control.
