### `subprocess.disconnect()`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.2
-->

Closes the IPC channel between parent and child, allowing the child to exit
gracefully once there are no other connections keeping it alive. After calling
this method the `subprocess.connected` and `process.connected` properties in
both the parent and child (respectively) will be set to `false`, and it will be
no longer possible to pass messages between the processes.

The `'disconnect'` event will be emitted when there are no messages in the
process of being received. This will most often be triggered immediately after
calling `subprocess.disconnect()`.

When the child process is a Node.js instance (e.g. spawned using
[`child_process.fork()`][]), the `process.disconnect()` method can be invoked
within the child process to close the IPC channel as well.
