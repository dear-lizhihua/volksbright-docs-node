#### `options.detached`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.10
-->

On Windows, setting `options.detached` to `true` makes it possible for the
child process to continue running after the parent exits. The child will have
its own console window. Once enabled for a child process, it cannot be
disabled.

On non-Windows platforms, if `options.detached` is set to `true`, the child
process will be made the leader of a new process group and session. Child
processes may continue running after the parent exits regardless of whether
they are detached or not. See setsid(2) for more information.

By default, the parent will wait for the detached child to exit. To prevent the
parent from waiting for a given `subprocess` to exit, use the
`subprocess.unref()` method. Doing so will cause the parent's event loop to not
include the child in its reference count, allowing the parent to exit
independently of the child, unless there is an established IPC channel between
the child and the parent.

When using the `detached` option to start a long-running process, the process
will not stay running in the background after the parent exits unless it is
provided with a `stdio` configuration that is not connected to the parent.
If the parent's `stdio` is inherited, the child will remain attached to the
controlling terminal.

Example of a long-running process, by detaching and also ignoring its parent
`stdio` file descriptors, in order to ignore the parent's termination:

```js
const { spawn } = require('node:child_process');

const subprocess = spawn(process.argv[0], ['child_program.js'], {
  detached: true,
  stdio: 'ignore',
});

subprocess.unref();
```

Alternatively one can redirect the child process' output into files:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');
const { spawn } = require('node:child_process');
const out = fs.openSync('./out.log', 'a');
const err = fs.openSync('./out.log', 'a');

const subprocess = spawn('prg', [], {
  detached: true,
  stdio: [ 'ignore', out, err ],
});

subprocess.unref();
```
