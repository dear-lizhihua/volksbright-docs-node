### Static method: `Buffer.from(array)`

<!-- YAML
added: v5.10.0
-->

* `array` {integer\[]}

Allocates a new `Buffer` using an `array` of bytes in the range `0` â€“ `255`.
Array entries outside that range will be truncated to fit into it.

```mjs
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

// Creates a new Buffer containing the UTF-8 bytes of the string 'buffer'.
const buf = Buffer.from([0x62, 0x75, 0x66, 0x66, 0x65, 0x72]);
```

```cjs
const { Buffer } = require('node:buffer');

// Creates a new Buffer containing the UTF-8 bytes of the string 'buffer'.
const buf = Buffer.from([0x62, 0x75, 0x66, 0x66, 0x65, 0x72]);
```

A `TypeError` will be thrown if `array` is not an `Array` or another type
appropriate for `Buffer.from()` variants.

`Buffer.from(array)` and [`Buffer.from(string)`][] may also use the internal
`Buffer` pool like [`Buffer.allocUnsafe()`][] does.
