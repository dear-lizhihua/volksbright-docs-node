When converting between `Buffer`s and strings, a character encoding may be
specified. If no character encoding is specified, UTF-8 will be used as the
default.

```mjs
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

const buf = Buffer.from('hello world', 'utf8');

console.log(buf.toString('hex'));
// Prints: 68656c6c6f20776f726c64
console.log(buf.toString('base64'));
// Prints: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=

console.log(Buffer.from('fhqwhgads', 'utf8'));
// Prints: <Buffer 66 68 71 77 68 67 61 64 73>
console.log(Buffer.from('fhqwhgads', 'utf16le'));
// Prints: <Buffer 66 00 68 00 71 00 77 00 68 00 67 00 61 00 64 00 73 00>
```

```cjs
const { Buffer } = require('node:buffer');

const buf = Buffer.from('hello world', 'utf8');

console.log(buf.toString('hex'));
// Prints: 68656c6c6f20776f726c64
console.log(buf.toString('base64'));
// Prints: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=

console.log(Buffer.from('fhqwhgads', 'utf8'));
// Prints: <Buffer 66 68 71 77 68 67 61 64 73>
console.log(Buffer.from('fhqwhgads', 'utf16le'));
// Prints: <Buffer 66 00 68 00 71 00 77 00 68 00 67 00 61 00 64 00 73 00>
```

Node.js buffers accept all case variations of encoding strings that they
receive. For example, UTF-8 can be specified as `'utf8'`, `'UTF8'`, or `'uTf8'`.

The character encodings currently supported by Node.js are the following:

* `'utf8'` (alias: `'utf-8'`): Multi-byte encoded Unicode characters. Many web
  pages and other document formats use [UTF-8][]. This is the default character
  encoding. When decoding a `Buffer` into a string that does not exclusively
  contain valid UTF-8 data, the Unicode replacement character `U+FFFD` ï¿½ will be
  used to represent those errors.

* `'utf16le'` (alias: `'utf-16le'`): Multi-byte encoded Unicode characters.
  Unlike `'utf8'`, each character in the string will be encoded using either 2
  or 4 bytes. Node.js only supports the [little-endian][endianness] variant of
  [UTF-16][].

* `'latin1'`: Latin-1 stands for [ISO-8859-1][]. This character encoding only
  supports the Unicode characters from `U+0000` to `U+00FF`. Each character is
  encoded using a single byte. Characters that do not fit into that range are
  truncated and will be mapped to characters in that range.

Converting a `Buffer` into a string using one of the above is referred to as
decoding, and converting a string into a `Buffer` is referred to as encoding.

Node.js also supports the following binary-to-text encodings. For
binary-to-text encodings, the naming convention is reversed: Converting a
`Buffer` into a string is typically referred to as encoding, and converting a
string into a `Buffer` as decoding.

* `'base64'`: [Base64][] encoding. When creating a `Buffer` from a string,
  this encoding will also correctly accept "URL and Filename Safe Alphabet" as
  specified in [RFC 4648, Section 5][]. Whitespace characters such as spaces,
  tabs, and new lines contained within the base64-encoded string are ignored.

* `'base64url'`: [base64url][] encoding as specified in
  [RFC 4648, Section 5][]. When creating a `Buffer` from a string, this
  encoding will also correctly accept regular base64-encoded strings. When
  encoding a `Buffer` to a string, this encoding will omit padding.

* `'hex'`: Encode each byte as two hexadecimal characters. Data truncation
  may occur when decoding strings that do not exclusively consist of an even
  number of hexadecimal characters. See below for an example.

The following legacy character encodings are also supported:

* `'ascii'`: For 7-bit [ASCII][] data only. When encoding a string into a
  `Buffer`, this is equivalent to using `'latin1'`. When decoding a `Buffer`
  into a string, using this encoding will additionally unset the highest bit of
  each byte before decoding as `'latin1'`.
  Generally, there should be no reason to use this encoding, as `'utf8'`
  (or, if the data is known to always be ASCII-only, `'latin1'`) will be a
  better choice when encoding or decoding ASCII-only text. It is only provided
  for legacy compatibility.

* `'binary'`: Alias for `'latin1'`. See [binary strings][] for more background
  on this topic. The name of this encoding can be very misleading, as all of the
  encodings listed here convert between strings and binary data. For converting
  between strings and `Buffer`s, typically `'utf8'` is the right choice.

* `'ucs2'`, `'ucs-2'`: Aliases of `'utf16le'`. UCS-2 used to refer to a variant
  of UTF-16 that did not support characters that had code points larger than
  U+FFFF. In Node.js, these code points are always supported.

```mjs
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

Buffer.from('1ag123', 'hex');
// Prints <Buffer 1a>, data truncated when first non-hexadecimal value
// ('g') encountered.

Buffer.from('1a7', 'hex');
// Prints <Buffer 1a>, data truncated when data ends in single digit ('7').

Buffer.from('1634', 'hex');
// Prints <Buffer 16 34>, all data represented.
```

```cjs
const { Buffer } = require('node:buffer');

Buffer.from('1ag123', 'hex');
// Prints <Buffer 1a>, data truncated when first non-hexadecimal value
// ('g') encountered.

Buffer.from('1a7', 'hex');
// Prints <Buffer 1a>, data truncated when data ends in single digit ('7').

Buffer.from('1634', 'hex');
// Prints <Buffer 16 34>, all data represented.
```

Modern Web browsers follow the [WHATWG Encoding Standard][] which aliases
both `'latin1'` and `'ISO-8859-1'` to `'win-1252'`. This means that while doing
something like `http.get()`, if the returned charset is one of those listed in
the WHATWG specification it is possible that the server actually returned
`'win-1252'`-encoded data, and using `'latin1'` encoding may incorrectly decode
the characters.
