### `buf.writeInt16BE(value[, offset])`

<!-- YAML

    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/18395
    description: Removed `noAssert` and no implicit coercion of the offset
                 to `uint32` anymore.
-->

* `value` {integer} Number to be written to `buf`.
* `offset` {integer} Number of bytes to skip before starting to write. Must
  satisfy `0 <= offset <= buf.length - 2`. **Default:** `0`.
* Returns: {integer} `offset` plus the number of bytes written.

Writes `value` to `buf` at the specified `offset` as big-endian.  The `value`
must be a valid signed 16-bit integer. Behavior is undefined when `value` is
anything other than a signed 16-bit integer.

The `value` is interpreted and written as a two's complement signed integer.

```mjs
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(2);

buf.writeInt16BE(0x0102, 0);

console.log(buf);
// Prints: <Buffer 01 02>
```

```cjs
const { Buffer } = require('node:buffer');

const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(2);

buf.writeInt16BE(0x0102, 0);

console.log(buf);
// Prints: <Buffer 01 02>
```
