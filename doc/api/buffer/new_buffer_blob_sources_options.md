    description: Added the standard `endings` option to replace line-endings,
                 and removed the non-standard `encoding` option.
-->

* `sources` {string\[]|ArrayBuffer\[]|TypedArray\[]|DataView\[]|Blob\[]} An
  array of string, {ArrayBuffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView}, or {Blob} objects,
  or any mix of such objects, that will be stored within the `Blob`.
* `options` {Object}
  * `endings` {string} One of either `'transparent'` or `'native'`. When set
    to `'native'`, line endings in string source parts will be converted to
    the platform native line-ending as specified by `require('node:os').EOL`.
  * `type` {string} The Blob content-type. The intent is for `type` to convey
    the MIME media type of the data, however no validation of the type format
    is performed.

Creates a new `Blob` object containing a concatenation of the given sources.

{ArrayBuffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView}, and {Buffer} sources are copied into
the 'Blob' and can therefore be safely modified after the 'Blob' is created.

String sources are encoded as UTF-8 byte sequences and copied into the Blob.
Unmatched surrogate pairs within each string part will be replaced by Unicode
U+FFFD replacement characters.
