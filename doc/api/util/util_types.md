`util.types` provides type checks for different kinds of built-in objects.
Unlike `instanceof` or `Object.prototype.toString.call(value)`, these checks do
not inspect properties of the object that are accessible from JavaScript (like
their prototype), and usually have the overhead of calling into C++.

The result generally does not make any guarantees about what kinds of
properties or behavior a value exposes in JavaScript. They are primarily
useful for addon developers who prefer to do type checking in JavaScript.

The API is accessible via `require('node:util').types` or `require('node:util/types')`.
