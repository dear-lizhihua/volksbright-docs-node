## `async_hooks.createHook(callbacks)`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.1.0
-->

* `callbacks` {Object} The [Hook Callbacks][] to register
  * `init` {Function} The [`init` callback][].
  * `before` {Function} The [`before` callback][].
  * `after` {Function} The [`after` callback][].
  * `destroy` {Function} The [`destroy` callback][].
  * `promiseResolve` {Function} The [`promiseResolve` callback][].
* Returns: {AsyncHook} Instance used for disabling and enabling hooks

Registers functions to be called for different lifetime events of each async
operation.

The callbacks `init()`/`before()`/`after()`/`destroy()` are called for the
respective asynchronous event during a resource's lifetime.

All callbacks are optional. For example, if only resource cleanup needs to
be tracked, then only the `destroy` callback needs to be passed. The
specifics of all functions that can be passed to `callbacks` is in the
[Hook Callbacks][] section.

```mjs
import { createHook } from 'node:async_hooks';

const asyncHook = createHook({
  init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) { },
  destroy(asyncId) { },
});
```

```cjs
const async_hooks = require('node:async_hooks');

const asyncHook = async_hooks.createHook({
  init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) { },
  destroy(asyncId) { },
});
```

The callbacks will be inherited via the prototype chain:

```js
class MyAsyncCallbacks {
  init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) { }
  destroy(asyncId) {}
}

class MyAddedCallbacks extends MyAsyncCallbacks {
  before(asyncId) { }
  after(asyncId) { }
}

const asyncHook = async_hooks.createHook(new MyAddedCallbacks());
```

Because promises are asynchronous resources whose lifecycle is tracked
via the async hooks mechanism, the `init()`, `before()`, `after()`, and
`destroy()` callbacks _must not_ be async functions that return promises.
