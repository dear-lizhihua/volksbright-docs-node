### Event: `'listening'`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.99
-->

The `'listening'` event is emitted once the `dgram.Socket` is addressable and
can receive data. This happens either explicitly with `socket.bind()` or
implicitly the first time data is sent using `socket.send()`.
Until the `dgram.Socket` is listening, the underlying system resources do not
exist and calls such as `socket.address()` and `socket.setTTL()` will fail.
