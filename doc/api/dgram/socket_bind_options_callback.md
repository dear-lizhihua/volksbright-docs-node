### `socket.bind(options[, callback])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.11.14
-->

* `options` {Object} Required. Supports the following properties:
  * `port` {integer}
  * `address` {string}
  * `exclusive` {boolean}
  * `fd` {integer}
* `callback` {Function}

For UDP sockets, causes the `dgram.Socket` to listen for datagram
messages on a named `port` and optional `address` that are passed as
properties of an `options` object passed as the first argument. If
`port` is not specified or is `0`, the operating system will attempt
to bind to a random port. If `address` is not specified, the operating
system will attempt to listen on all addresses. Once binding is
complete, a `'listening'` event is emitted and the optional `callback`
function is called.

The `options` object may contain a `fd` property. When a `fd` greater
than `0` is set, it will wrap around an existing socket with the given
file descriptor. In this case, the properties of `port` and `address`
will be ignored.

Specifying both a `'listening'` event listener and passing a
`callback` to the `socket.bind()` method is not harmful but not very
useful.

The `options` object may contain an additional `exclusive` property that is
used when using `dgram.Socket` objects with the [`cluster`][] module. When
`exclusive` is set to `false` (the default), cluster workers will use the same
underlying socket handle allowing connection handling duties to be shared.
When `exclusive` is `true`, however, the handle is not shared and attempted
port sharing results in an error.

A bound datagram socket keeps the Node.js process running to receive
datagram messages.

If binding fails, an `'error'` event is generated. In rare case (e.g.
attempting to bind with a closed socket), an [`Error`][] may be thrown.

An example socket listening on an exclusive port is shown below.

```js
socket.bind({
  address: 'localhost',
  port: 8000,
  exclusive: true,
});
```
