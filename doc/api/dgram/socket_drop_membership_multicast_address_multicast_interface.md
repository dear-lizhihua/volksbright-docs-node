### `socket.dropMembership(multicastAddress[, multicastInterface])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.6.9
-->

* `multicastAddress` {string}
* `multicastInterface` {string}

Instructs the kernel to leave a multicast group at `multicastAddress` using the
`IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP` socket option. This method is automatically called by the
kernel when the socket is closed or the process terminates, so most apps will
never have reason to call this.

If `multicastInterface` is not specified, the operating system will attempt to
drop membership on all valid interfaces.
