-->

* `msg` {Buffer|TypedArray|DataView|string|Array} Message to be sent.
* `offset` {integer} Offset in the buffer where the message starts.
* `length` {integer} Number of bytes in the message.
* `port` {integer} Destination port.
* `address` {string} Destination host name or IP address.
* `callback` {Function} Called when the message has been sent.

Broadcasts a datagram on the socket.
For connectionless sockets, the destination `port` and `address` must be
specified. Connected sockets, on the other hand, will use their associated
remote endpoint, so the `port` and `address` arguments must not be set.

The `msg` argument contains the message to be sent.
Depending on its type, different behavior can apply. If `msg` is a `Buffer`,
any `TypedArray` or a `DataView`,
the `offset` and `length` specify the offset within the `Buffer` where the
message begins and the number of bytes in the message, respectively.
If `msg` is a `String`, then it is automatically converted to a `Buffer`
with `'utf8'` encoding. With messages that
contain multi-byte characters, `offset` and `length` will be calculated with
respect to [byte length][] and not the character position.
If `msg` is an array, `offset` and `length` must not be specified.

The `address` argument is a string. If the value of `address` is a host name,
DNS will be used to resolve the address of the host. If `address` is not
provided or otherwise nullish, `'127.0.0.1'` (for `udp4` sockets) or `'::1'`
(for `udp6` sockets) will be used by default.

If the socket has not been previously bound with a call to `bind`, the socket
is assigned a random port number and is bound to the "all interfaces" address
(`'0.0.0.0'` for `udp4` sockets, `'::0'` for `udp6` sockets.)

An optional `callback` function may be specified to as a way of reporting
DNS errors or for determining when it is safe to reuse the `buf` object.
DNS lookups delay the time to send for at least one tick of the
Node.js event loop.

The only way to know for sure that the datagram has been sent is by using a
`callback`. If an error occurs and a `callback` is given, the error will be
passed as the first argument to the `callback`. If a `callback` is not given,
the error is emitted as an `'error'` event on the `socket` object.

Offset and length are optional but both _must_ be set if either are used.
They are supported only when the first argument is a `Buffer`, a `TypedArray`,
or a `DataView`.

This method throws [`ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT`][] if called on an unbound socket.

Example of sending a UDP packet to a port on `localhost`;

```mjs
import dgram from 'node:dgram';
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

const message = Buffer.from('Some bytes');
const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
client.send(message, 41234, 'localhost', (err) => {
  client.close();
});
```

```cjs
const dgram = require('node:dgram');
const { Buffer } = require('node:buffer');

const message = Buffer.from('Some bytes');
const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
client.send(message, 41234, 'localhost', (err) => {
  client.close();
});
```

Example of sending a UDP packet composed of multiple buffers to a port on
`127.0.0.1`;

```mjs
import dgram from 'node:dgram';
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

const buf1 = Buffer.from('Some ');
const buf2 = Buffer.from('bytes');
const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
client.send([buf1, buf2], 41234, (err) => {
  client.close();
});
```

```cjs
const dgram = require('node:dgram');
const { Buffer } = require('node:buffer');

const buf1 = Buffer.from('Some ');
const buf2 = Buffer.from('bytes');
const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
client.send([buf1, buf2], 41234, (err) => {
  client.close();
});
```

Sending multiple buffers might be faster or slower depending on the
application and operating system. Run benchmarks to
determine the optimal strategy on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking,
however, sending multiple buffers is faster.

Example of sending a UDP packet using a socket connected to a port on
`localhost`:

```mjs
import dgram from 'node:dgram';
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

const message = Buffer.from('Some bytes');
const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
client.connect(41234, 'localhost', (err) => {
  client.send(message, (err) => {
    client.close();
  });
});
```

```cjs
const dgram = require('node:dgram');
const { Buffer } = require('node:buffer');

const message = Buffer.from('Some bytes');
const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
client.connect(41234, 'localhost', (err) => {
  client.send(message, (err) => {
    client.close();
  });
});
```
