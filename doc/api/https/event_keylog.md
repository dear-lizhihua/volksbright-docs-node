#### Event: `'keylog'`

<!-- YAML

* `line` {Buffer} Line of ASCII text, in NSS `SSLKEYLOGFILE` format.
* `tlsSocket` {tls.TLSSocket} The `tls.TLSSocket` instance on which it was
  generated.

The `keylog` event is emitted when key material is generated or received by a
connection managed by this agent (typically before handshake has completed, but
not necessarily). This keying material can be stored for debugging, as it
allows captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. It may be emitted multiple times
for each socket.

A typical use case is to append received lines to a common text file, which is
later used by software (such as Wireshark) to decrypt the traffic:

```js
// ...
https.globalAgent.on('keylog', (line, tlsSocket) => {
  fs.appendFileSync('/tmp/ssl-keys.log', line, { mode: 0o600 });
});
```
