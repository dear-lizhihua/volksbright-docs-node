### `tlsSocket.getPeerCertificate([detailed])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.11.4
-->

* `detailed` {boolean} Include the full certificate chain if `true`, otherwise
  include just the peer's certificate.
* Returns: {Object} A certificate object.

Returns an object representing the peer's certificate. If the peer does not
provide a certificate, an empty object will be returned. If the socket has been
destroyed, `null` will be returned.

If the full certificate chain was requested, each certificate will include an
`issuerCertificate` property containing an object representing its issuer's
certificate.
