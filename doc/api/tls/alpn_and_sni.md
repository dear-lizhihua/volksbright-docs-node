### ALPN and SNI

<!-- type=misc -->

ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension) and
SNI (Server Name Indication) are TLS handshake extensions:

* ALPN: Allows the use of one TLS server for multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTP/2)
* SNI: Allows the use of one TLS server for multiple hostnames with different
  certificates.
