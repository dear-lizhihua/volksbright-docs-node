### `tlsSocket.enableTrace()`

<!-- YAML
added: v12.2.0
-->

When enabled, TLS packet trace information is written to `stderr`. This can be
used to debug TLS connection problems.

The format of the output is identical to the output of
`openssl s_client -trace` or `openssl s_server -trace`. While it is produced by
OpenSSL's `SSL_trace()` function, the format is undocumented, can change
without notice, and should not be relied on.
