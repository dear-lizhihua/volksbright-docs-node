## `tls.getCiphers()`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.10.2
-->

* Returns: {string\[]}

Returns an array with the names of the supported TLS ciphers. The names are
lower-case for historical reasons, but must be uppercased to be used in
the `ciphers` option of [`tls.createSecureContext()`][].

Not all supported ciphers are enabled by default. See
[Modifying the default TLS cipher suite][].

Cipher names that start with `'tls_'` are for TLSv1.3, all the others are for
TLSv1.2 and below.

```js
console.log(tls.getCiphers()); // ['aes128-gcm-sha256', 'aes128-sha', ...]
```
