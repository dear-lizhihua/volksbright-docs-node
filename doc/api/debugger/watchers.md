## Watchers

It is possible to watch expression and variable values while debugging. On
every breakpoint, each expression from the watchers list will be evaluated
in the current context and displayed immediately before the breakpoint's
source code listing.

To begin watching an expression, type `watch('my_expression')`. The command
`watchers` will print the active watchers. To remove a watcher, type
`unwatch('my_expression')`.
