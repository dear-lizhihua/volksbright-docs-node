#### `urlObject.pathname`

The `pathname` property consists of the entire path section of the URL. This
is everything following the `host` (including the `port`) and before the start
of the `query` or `hash` components, delimited by either the ASCII question
mark (`?`) or hash (`#`) characters.

For example: `'/p/a/t/h'`.

No decoding of the path string is performed.
