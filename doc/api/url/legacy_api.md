### Legacy API

Within the Legacy API, spaces (`' '`) and the following characters will be
automatically escaped in the properties of URL objects:

```text
< > " ` \r \n \t { } | \ ^ '
```

For example, the ASCII space character (`' '`) is encoded as `%20`. The ASCII
forward slash (`/`) character is encoded as `%3C`.
