## Class: `MessageChannel`

<!-- YAML
added: v10.5.0
-->

Instances of the `worker.MessageChannel` class represent an asynchronous,
two-way communications channel.
The `MessageChannel` has no methods of its own. `new MessageChannel()`
yields an object with `port1` and `port2` properties, which refer to linked
[`MessagePort`][] instances.

```js
const { MessageChannel } = require('node:worker_threads');

const { port1, port2 } = new MessageChannel();
port1.on('message', (message) => console.log('received', message));
port2.postMessage({ foo: 'bar' });
// Prints: received { foo: 'bar' } from the `port1.on('message')` listener
```
