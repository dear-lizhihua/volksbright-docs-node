## `worker.workerData`

<!-- YAML
added: v10.5.0
-->

An arbitrary JavaScript value that contains a clone of the data passed
to this thread's `Worker` constructor.

The data is cloned as if using [`postMessage()`][`port.postMessage()`],
according to the [HTML structured clone algorithm][].

```js
const { Worker, isMainThread, workerData } = require('node:worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
  const worker = new Worker(__filename, { workerData: 'Hello, world!' });
} else {
  console.log(workerData);  // Prints 'Hello, world!'.
}
```
