#### Considerations when cloning objects with prototypes, classes, and accessors

Because object cloning uses the [HTML structured clone algorithm][],
non-enumerable properties, property accessors, and object prototypes are
not preserved. In particular, [`Buffer`][] objects will be read as
plain [`Uint8Array`][]s on the receiving side, and instances of JavaScript
classes will be cloned as plain JavaScript objects.

```js
const b = Symbol('b');

class Foo {
  #a = 1;
  constructor() {
    this[b] = 2;
    this.c = 3;
  }

  get d() { return 4; }
}

const { port1, port2 } = new MessageChannel();

port1.onmessage = ({ data }) => console.log(data);

port2.postMessage(new Foo());

// Prints: { c: 3 }
```

This limitation extends to many built-in objects, such as the global `URL`
object:

```js
const { port1, port2 } = new MessageChannel();

port1.onmessage = ({ data }) => console.log(data);

port2.postMessage(new URL('https://example.org'));

// Prints: { }
```
