## `worker.SHARE_ENV`

<!-- YAML
added: v11.14.0
-->

* {symbol}

A special value that can be passed as the `env` option of the [`Worker`][]
constructor, to indicate that the current thread and the Worker thread should
share read and write access to the same set of environment variables.

```js
const { Worker, SHARE_ENV } = require('node:worker_threads');
new Worker('process.env.SET_IN_WORKER = "foo"', { eval: true, env: SHARE_ENV })
  .on('exit', () => {
    console.log(process.env.SET_IN_WORKER);  // Prints 'foo'.
  });
```
