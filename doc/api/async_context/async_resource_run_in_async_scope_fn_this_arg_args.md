### `asyncResource.runInAsyncScope(fn[, thisArg, ...args])`

<!-- YAML
added: v9.6.0
-->

* `fn` {Function} The function to call in the execution context of this async
  resource.
* `thisArg` {any} The receiver to be used for the function call.
* `...args` {any} Optional arguments to pass to the function.

Call the provided function with the provided arguments in the execution context
of the async resource. This will establish the context, trigger the AsyncHooks
before callbacks, call the function, trigger the AsyncHooks after callbacks, and
then restore the original execution context.
