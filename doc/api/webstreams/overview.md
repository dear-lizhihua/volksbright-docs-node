## Overview

The [WHATWG Streams Standard][] (or "web streams") defines an API for handling
streaming data. It is similar to the Node.js [Streams][] API but emerged later
and has become the "standard" API for streaming data across many JavaScript
environments.

There are three primary types of objects:

* `ReadableStream` - Represents a source of streaming data.
* `WritableStream` - Represents a destination for streaming data.
* `TransformStream` - Represents an algorithm for transforming streaming data.
