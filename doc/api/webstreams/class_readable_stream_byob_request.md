When using `ReadableByteStreamController` in byte-oriented
streams, and when using the `ReadableStreamBYOBReader`,
the `readableByteStreamController.byobRequest` property
provides access to a `ReadableStreamBYOBRequest` instance
that represents the current read request. The object
is used to gain access to the `ArrayBuffer`/`TypedArray`
that has been provided for the read request to fill,
and provides methods for signaling that the data has
been provided.
