### Utility Consumers

<!-- YAML
added: v16.7.0
-->

The utility consumer functions provide common options for consuming
streams.

They are accessed using:

```mjs
import {
  arrayBuffer,
  blob,
  buffer,
  json,
  text,
} from 'node:stream/consumers';
```

```cjs
const {
  arrayBuffer,
  blob,
  buffer,
  json,
  text,
} = require('node:stream/consumers');
```
