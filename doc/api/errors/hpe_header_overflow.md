    description: Max header size in `http_parser` was set to 8 KiB.
-->

Too much HTTP header data was received. In order to protect against malicious or
malconfigured clients, if more than 8 KiB of HTTP header data is received then
HTTP parsing will abort without a request or response object being created, and
an `Error` with this code will be emitted.
