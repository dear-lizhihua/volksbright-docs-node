    description: Rather than emitting an error, `process.stderr.end()` now
                 only closes the stream side but not the underlying resource,
                 making this error obsolete.
-->

An attempt was made to close the `process.stdout` stream. By design, Node.js
does not allow `stdout` or `stderr` streams to be closed by user code.
