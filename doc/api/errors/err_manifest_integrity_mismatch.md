### `ERR_MANIFEST_INTEGRITY_MISMATCH`

An attempt was made to load a policy manifest, but the manifest had multiple
entries for a resource which did not match each other. Update the manifest
entries to match in order to resolve this error. See the documentation for
[policy][] manifests for more information.
