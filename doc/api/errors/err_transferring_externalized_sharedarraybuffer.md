### `ERR_TRANSFERRING_EXTERNALIZED_SHAREDARRAYBUFFER`

<!-- YAML
added: v10.5.0
removed: v14.0.0
-->

A `SharedArrayBuffer` whose memory is not managed by the JavaScript engine
or by Node.js was encountered during serialization. Such a `SharedArrayBuffer`
cannot be serialized.

This can only happen when native addons create `SharedArrayBuffer`s in
"externalized" mode, or put existing `SharedArrayBuffer` into externalized mode.
