### `ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ARGUMENT`

A function argument is being used in a way that suggests that the function
signature may be misunderstood. This is thrown by the `node:assert` module when
the `message` parameter in `assert.throws(block, message)` matches the error
message thrown by `block` because that usage suggests that the user believes
`message` is the expected message rather than the message the `AssertionError`
will display if `block` does not throw.
