### `ERR_BUFFER_CONTEXT_NOT_AVAILABLE`

An attempt was made to create a Node.js `Buffer` instance from addon or embedder
code, while in a JS engine Context that is not associated with a Node.js
instance. The data passed to the `Buffer` method will have been released
by the time the method returns.

When encountering this error, a possible alternative to creating a `Buffer`
instance is to create a normal `Uint8Array`, which only differs in the
prototype of the resulting object. `Uint8Array`s are generally accepted in all
Node.js core APIs where `Buffer`s are; they are available in all Contexts.
