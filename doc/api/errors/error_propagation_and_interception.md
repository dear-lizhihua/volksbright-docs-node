## Error propagation and interception

<!--type=misc-->

Node.js supports several mechanisms for propagating and handling errors that
occur while an application is running. How these errors are reported and
handled depends entirely on the type of `Error` and the style of the API that is
called.

All JavaScript errors are handled as exceptions that _immediately_ generate
and throw an error using the standard JavaScript `throw` mechanism. These
are handled using the [`try…catch` construct][try-catch] provided by the
JavaScript language.

```js
// Throws with a ReferenceError because z is not defined.
try {
  const m = 1;
  const n = m + z;
} catch (err) {
  // Handle the error here.
}
```

Any use of the JavaScript `throw` mechanism will raise an exception that
_must_ be handled using `try…catch` or the Node.js process will exit
immediately.

With few exceptions, _Synchronous_ APIs (any blocking method that does not
accept a `callback` function, such as [`fs.readFileSync`][]), will use `throw`
to report errors.

Errors that occur within _Asynchronous APIs_ may be reported in multiple ways:

* Most asynchronous methods that accept a `callback` function will accept an
  `Error` object passed as the first argument to that function. If that first
  argument is not `null` and is an instance of `Error`, then an error occurred
  that should be handled.

  <!-- eslint-disable no-useless-return -->

  ```js
  const fs = require('node:fs');
  fs.readFile('a file that does not exist', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('There was an error reading the file!', err);
      return;
    }
    // Otherwise handle the data
  });
  ```

* When an asynchronous method is called on an object that is an
  [`EventEmitter`][], errors can be routed to that object's `'error'` event.

  ```js
  const net = require('node:net');
  const connection = net.connect('localhost');

  // Adding an 'error' event handler to a stream:
  connection.on('error', (err) => {
    // If the connection is reset by the server, or if it can't
    // connect at all, or on any sort of error encountered by
    // the connection, the error will be sent here.
    console.error(err);
  });

  connection.pipe(process.stdout);
  ```

* A handful of typically asynchronous methods in the Node.js API may still
  use the `throw` mechanism to raise exceptions that must be handled using
  `try…catch`. There is no comprehensive list of such methods; please
  refer to the documentation of each method to determine the appropriate
  error handling mechanism required.

The use of the `'error'` event mechanism is most common for [stream-based][]
and [event emitter-based][] APIs, which themselves represent a series of
asynchronous operations over time (as opposed to a single operation that may
pass or fail).

For _all_ [`EventEmitter`][] objects, if an `'error'` event handler is not
provided, the error will be thrown, causing the Node.js process to report an
uncaught exception and crash unless either: The [`domain`][domains] module is
used appropriately or a handler has been registered for the
[`'uncaughtException'`][] event.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('node:events');
const ee = new EventEmitter();

setImmediate(() => {
  // This will crash the process because no 'error' event
  // handler has been added.
  ee.emit('error', new Error('This will crash'));
});
```

Errors generated in this way _cannot_ be intercepted using `try…catch` as
they are thrown _after_ the calling code has already exited.

Developers must refer to the documentation for each method to determine
exactly how errors raised by those methods are propagated.
