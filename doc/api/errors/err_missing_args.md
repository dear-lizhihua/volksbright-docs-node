### `ERR_MISSING_ARGS`

A required argument of a Node.js API was not passed. This is only used for
strict compliance with the API specification (which in some cases may accept
`func(undefined)` but not `func()`). In most native Node.js APIs,
`func(undefined)` and `func()` are treated identically, and the
[`ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE`][] error code may be used instead.
