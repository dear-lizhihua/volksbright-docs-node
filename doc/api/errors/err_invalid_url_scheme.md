### `ERR_INVALID_URL_SCHEME`

An attempt was made to use a URL of an incompatible scheme (protocol) for a
specific purpose. It is only used in the [WHATWG URL API][] support in the
[`fs`][] module (which only accepts URLs with `'file'` scheme), but may be used
in other Node.js APIs as well in the future.
