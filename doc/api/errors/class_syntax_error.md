## Class: `SyntaxError`

* Extends: {errors.Error}

Indicates that a program is not valid JavaScript. These errors may only be
generated and propagated as a result of code evaluation. Code evaluation may
happen as a result of `eval`, `Function`, `require`, or [vm][]. These errors
are almost always indicative of a broken program.

```js
try {
  require('node:vm').runInThisContext('binary ! isNotOk');
} catch (err) {
  // 'err' will be a SyntaxError.
}
```

`SyntaxError` instances are unrecoverable in the context that created them â€“
they may only be caught by other contexts.
