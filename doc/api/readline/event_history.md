### Event: `'history'`

<!-- YAML
added:
  - v15.8.0
  - v14.18.0
-->

The `'history'` event is emitted whenever the history array has changed.

The listener function is called with an array containing the history array.
It will reflect all changes, added lines and removed lines due to
`historySize` and `removeHistoryDuplicates`.

The primary purpose is to allow a listener to persist the history.
It is also possible for the listener to change the history object. This
could be useful to prevent certain lines to be added to the history, like
a password.

```js
rl.on('history', (history) => {
  console.log(`Received: ${history}`);
});
```
