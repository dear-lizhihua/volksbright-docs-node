#### Use of the `completer` function

The `completer` function takes the current line entered by the user
as an argument, and returns an `Array` with 2 entries:

* An `Array` with matching entries for the completion.
* The substring that was used for the matching.

For instance: `[[substr1, substr2, ...], originalsubstring]`.

```js
function completer(line) {
  const completions = '.help .error .exit .quit .q'.split(' ');
  const hits = completions.filter((c) => c.startsWith(line));
  // Show all completions if none found
  return [hits.length ? hits : completions, line];
}
```

The `completer` function can also returns a {Promise}, or be asynchronous:

```js
async function completer(linePartial) {
  await someAsyncWork();
  return [['123'], linePartial];
}
```
