### `rl.cursor`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.98
-->

* {number|undefined}

The cursor position relative to `rl.line`.

This will track where the current cursor lands in the input string, when
reading input from a TTY stream. The position of cursor determines the
portion of the input string that will be modified as input is processed,
as well as the column where the terminal caret will be rendered.
