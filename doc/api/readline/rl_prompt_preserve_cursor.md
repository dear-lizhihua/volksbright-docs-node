### `rl.prompt([preserveCursor])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.98
-->

* `preserveCursor` {boolean} If `true`, prevents the cursor placement from
  being reset to `0`.

The `rl.prompt()` method writes the `InterfaceConstructor` instances configured
`prompt` to a new line in `output` in order to provide a user with a new
location at which to provide input.

When called, `rl.prompt()` will resume the `input` stream if it has been
paused.

If the `InterfaceConstructor` was created with `output` set to `null` or
`undefined` the prompt is not written.
