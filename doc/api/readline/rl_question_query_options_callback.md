#### `rl.question(query[, options], callback)`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* `query` {string} A statement or query to write to `output`, prepended to the
  prompt.
* `options` {Object}
  * `signal` {AbortSignal} Optionally allows the `question()` to be canceled
    using an `AbortController`.
* `callback` {Function} A callback function that is invoked with the user's
  input in response to the `query`.

The `rl.question()` method displays the `query` by writing it to the `output`,
waits for user input to be provided on `input`, then invokes the `callback`
function passing the provided input as the first argument.

When called, `rl.question()` will resume the `input` stream if it has been
paused.

If the `readline.Interface` was created with `output` set to `null` or
`undefined` the `query` is not written.

The `callback` function passed to `rl.question()` does not follow the typical
pattern of accepting an `Error` object or `null` as the first argument.
The `callback` is called with the provided answer as the only argument.

An error will be thrown if calling `rl.question()` after `rl.close()`.

Example usage:

```js
rl.question('What is your favorite food? ', (answer) => {
  console.log(`Oh, so your favorite food is ${answer}`);
});
```

Using an `AbortController` to cancel a question.

```js
const ac = new AbortController();
const signal = ac.signal;

rl.question('What is your favorite food? ', { signal }, (answer) => {
  console.log(`Oh, so your favorite food is ${answer}`);
});

signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
  console.log('The food question timed out');
}, { once: true });

setTimeout(() => ac.abort(), 10000);
```
