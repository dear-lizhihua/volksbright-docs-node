### `readlinePromises.createInterface(options)`

<!-- YAML
added: v17.0.0
-->

* `options` {Object}
  * `input` {stream.Readable} The [Readable][] stream to listen to. This option
    is _required_.
  * `output` {stream.Writable} The [Writable][] stream to write readline data
    to.
  * `completer` {Function} An optional function used for Tab autocompletion.
  * `terminal` {boolean} `true` if the `input` and `output` streams should be
    treated like a TTY, and have ANSI/VT100 escape codes written to it.
    **Default:** checking `isTTY` on the `output` stream upon instantiation.
  * `history` {string\[]} Initial list of history lines. This option makes sense
    only if `terminal` is set to `true` by the user or by an internal `output`
    check, otherwise the history caching mechanism is not initialized at all.
    **Default:** `[]`.
  * `historySize` {number} Maximum number of history lines retained. To disable
    the history set this value to `0`. This option makes sense only if
    `terminal` is set to `true` by the user or by an internal `output` check,
    otherwise the history caching mechanism is not initialized at all.
    **Default:** `30`.
  * `removeHistoryDuplicates` {boolean} If `true`, when a new input line added
    to the history list duplicates an older one, this removes the older line
    from the list. **Default:** `false`.
  * `prompt` {string} The prompt string to use. **Default:** `'> '`.
  * `crlfDelay` {number} If the delay between `\r` and `\n` exceeds
    `crlfDelay` milliseconds, both `\r` and `\n` will be treated as separate
    end-of-line input. `crlfDelay` will be coerced to a number no less than
    `100`. It can be set to `Infinity`, in which case `\r` followed by `\n`
    will always be considered a single newline (which may be reasonable for
    [reading files][] with `\r\n` line delimiter). **Default:** `100`.
  * `escapeCodeTimeout` {number} The duration `readlinePromises` will wait for a
    character (when reading an ambiguous key sequence in milliseconds one that
    can both form a complete key sequence using the input read so far and can
    take additional input to complete a longer key sequence).
    **Default:** `500`.
  * `tabSize` {integer} The number of spaces a tab is equal to (minimum 1).
    **Default:** `8`.
* Returns: {readlinePromises.Interface}

The `readlinePromises.createInterface()` method creates a new `readlinePromises.Interface`
instance.

```js
const readlinePromises = require('node:readline/promises');
const rl = readlinePromises.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});
```

Once the `readlinePromises.Interface` instance is created, the most common case
is to listen for the `'line'` event:

```js
rl.on('line', (line) => {
  console.log(`Received: ${line}`);
});
```

If `terminal` is `true` for this instance then the `output` stream will get
the best compatibility if it defines an `output.columns` property and emits
a `'resize'` event on the `output` if or when the columns ever change
([`process.stdout`][] does this automatically when it is a TTY).
