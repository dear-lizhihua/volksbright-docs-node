## Example: Read file stream line-by-Line

A common use case for `readline` is to consume an input file one line at a
time. The easiest way to do so is leveraging the [`fs.ReadStream`][] API as
well as a `for await...of` loop:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');
const readline = require('node:readline');

async function processLineByLine() {
  const fileStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');

  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: fileStream,
    crlfDelay: Infinity,
  });
  // Note: we use the crlfDelay option to recognize all instances of CR LF
  // ('\r\n') in input.txt as a single line break.

  for await (const line of rl) {
    // Each line in input.txt will be successively available here as `line`.
    console.log(`Line from file: ${line}`);
  }
}

processLineByLine();
```

Alternatively, one could use the [`'line'`][] event:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');
const readline = require('node:readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: fs.createReadStream('sample.txt'),
  crlfDelay: Infinity,
});

rl.on('line', (line) => {
  console.log(`Line from file: ${line}`);
});
```

Currently, `for await...of` loop can be a bit slower. If `async` / `await`
flow and speed are both essential, a mixed approach can be applied:

```js
const { once } = require('node:events');
const { createReadStream } = require('node:fs');
const { createInterface } = require('node:readline');

(async function processLineByLine() {
  try {
    const rl = createInterface({
      input: createReadStream('big-file.txt'),
      crlfDelay: Infinity,
    });

    rl.on('line', (line) => {
      // Process the line.
    });

    await once(rl, 'close');

    console.log('File processed.');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```
