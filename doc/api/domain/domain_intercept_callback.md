### `domain.intercept(callback)`

* `callback` {Function} The callback function
* Returns: {Function} The intercepted function

This method is almost identical to [`domain.bind(callback)`][]. However, in
addition to catching thrown errors, it will also intercept [`Error`][]
objects sent as the first argument to the function.

In this way, the common `if (err) return callback(err);` pattern can be replaced
with a single error handler in a single place.

```js
const d = domain.create();

function readSomeFile(filename, cb) {
  fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8', d.intercept((data) => {
    // Note, the first argument is never passed to the
    // callback since it is assumed to be the 'Error' argument
    // and thus intercepted by the domain.

    // If this throws, it will also be passed to the domain
    // so the error-handling logic can be moved to the 'error'
    // event on the domain instead of being repeated throughout
    // the program.
    return cb(null, JSON.parse(data));
  }));
}

d.on('error', (er) => {
  // An error occurred somewhere. If we throw it now, it will crash the program
  // with the normal line number and stack message.
});
```
